", and is very, very accurate .
 but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .
 This function is not accurate if you don't leave it in battery mode say, when you stop at the Cracker Barrell for lunch and to play one of those trangle games with the tees .
 It provides immediate alternatives if the route from the online map program was inaccurate or blocked by an obstacle .
 I've used other GPS units, as well as GPS built into cars   and to this day NOTHING beats the accuracy of a Garmin GPS .
 It got me from point A to point B with 100% accuracy everytime .
 It has yet to disappoint, getting me everywhere with 100% accuracy .
0 out of 5 stars Honest, accurate review, , PLEASE READ !
 Aside from that, every destination I've thrown at has been 100% accurate .
In closing, this is a fantastic GPS with some very nice features and is very accurate in directions .
 Plus, I've always heard that there are  quirks  with any GPS being accurate, having POIs, etc .
 DESTINATION TIME, , This is pretty accurate too .
 But, it's always very accurate .
 The map is pretty accurate and the Point of interest database also is good .
 Most of the times, this info was very accurate .
I've even used it in the  pedestrian  mode, and it's amazing how accurate it is .
  ONLY  is only accurate when an ad says,  Top sirloin steak, ONLY $1 .
 The most accurate review stated that these machines are adjunct to a good map and signs on the interstate .
 The directions are highly accurate down to a  T  .
 Depending on what you are using it for, it is a nice adjunct to a travel trip and the directions are accurate and usually the quickest, but not always .
 The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .
 It was accurate to the minute when it told me when I would arrive home .
0 out of 5 stars GPS Navigator doesn't navigate accurately on a straight road .
 I was familiar with the streets and only used the Nuvi to get an accurate arrival time estimate .
 but after that it is very easy and quite accurate to use .
 The accuracy at this point is very good .
While the 255W routing seems generally accurate and logical, on my first use I discovered that it does have some errors in its internal map .
 Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .
 I've used it around town and find it to be extremely accurate .
I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .
 A lot of my friends' addresses are inaccurate by any GPS .
 It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .
 Because the accuracy is good to the street address level, it may not be able to guide you to the exact location if your destination is inside a shopping mall .
I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .
 I was blown away at the accuracy and routing capability this thing had .
 I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .
 If your looking for a nice, accurate GPS for not so much money, got with this one .
0 out of 5 stars Inexpensive, accurate, plenty of features, August 6, 2009
 The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .
 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .
 The closest one that gives the most accurate route that I usually take is the Navigon .
 After 2 weeks, it has yet to make a mistake, and is always completely accurate ,  even to the point of telling me which side of the street my destination is on .
 It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .
The estimated time to arrival does not seem to calculate the travelling time accurately .
Accuracy is as good as any other unit, they all sometimes tell you you have arrived when you haven't, or continue to tell you to turn when you're already there .
 Accuracy is determined by the maps .
 Less traveled rural roads will not be accurate on any unit .
 Accuracy is within a few yards .
What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .
 The Garmin is loaded with very accurate maps that generally know the roads in even the remotest areas .
I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .
My new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .
 I had a GPS 10, years ago when I owned a boat that was difficult to use and with very poor accuracy so I had assumed that the road GPS wasn't any better .
 Practiced visiting places I already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .
 Easy to use, excellent accuracy, nice and intuitive interface .
 The directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .
,  Very Accurate but with one small glitch I found ,  I'll explain in the CONS
This is a great GPS, it is so easy to use and it is always accurate .
Very easy to operate and pretty accurate as well, only led me astray once and that was in northern Maine where roads are few and paved ones fewer .
 Easy to use and amazed at how accurate this item is .
To date it's been a very easy to use and accurate .
 Mounted really easily and has been very accurate .
 seems to be rather accurate .
 It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .
Highly accurate, POIs are great .
 I can't believe how accurate and detailed the information estimated time of arrival,speed limits along the way,and detailed map of my route, to name a few .
 Speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch .

" The room was not overly big, but clean and very comfortable beds, a great shower and very clean bathrooms .
 The second room was smaller, with a very inconvenient bathroom layout, but at least it was quieter and we were able to sleep .
 Large comfortable room, wonderful bathroom .
 The rooms were nice, very comfy bed and very clean bathroom .
 Bathroom was spacious too and very clean .
 The bathroom only had a single sink, but it was very large .
 The room was a standard but nice motel room like any other, bathroom seemed upgraded if I remember .
The room was quite small but perfectly formed with a super bathroom .
 You could eat off the bathroom floor it was so clean .
 The bathroom door does the same thing, making the bathroom seem slightly larger .
bathroom spotless and nicely appointed .
 The rooms are exceptionally clean and also the bathrooms .
 The bathroom was clean and the bed was comfy .
 They provide you with great aveda products in the bathroom .
 Also, the bathroom was a bit dirty ,  brown water came out of the bath tub faucet initially and the sink wall by the toilet was dirty .
 If your dog tends to be a little disruptive or on the noisy side, there is a bathroom fan that you can keep on to make noise .
 The bathroom was big and clean as well .
 Also, the bathrooms were quite well set up, with a seperate toilet shower to basin, so whilst one guest is showering another can use the basin .
 The bathroom was marble and we had luxurious bathrobes and really, every detail attended to .
 It was very clean, had a beautiful bathroom, and was comfortable .
 The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was clean with a nice selection of toiletries .
 The bathroom was an adequate size .
First, from day one our bathroom had a urine smell that never went away .
 Otherwise the bathroom was decent enough ,  decent temperature and decent water pressure .
 Bathroom shower curtain reeked of mildew enough to smell up the room .
 The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .
 The room was very nice, and had a nice bathroom .
 The room was wonderful with great beds, a nice bathroom and we also had an excellent view of Coit Tower as well .
 The room was small, with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom .
Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .
 The bathroom was clean, well lit, and always well stocked with shampoo etc and towels .
 The only odd thing was the bathroom door and room door opened outwards into the room and hallway respectively .
 Room spacious 2 double beds gave us plenty of room, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size .
 The bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror .
 The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .
 Shower bathroom was good with good shower and plenty of space .
 Both the bedroom and bathroom had plenty of room .
 large clean bathrooms fully stocked with everything needed .
 However, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they're doing work in some units .
 The room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom .
 There is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom .
The thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated .
 There is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all .
 Upon our arrival, there was a SLIGHT odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about .
 The bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels .
 The bathroom was large and private .
 The bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to .
The Tuscan Inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs   TV adequate, the bathroom reasonably good .
my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005 .
 The clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward .
 The bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it .
 Turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated  and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up .
 The room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small .
 Bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer .
 The wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower .
 The bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable .
 The bathroom had several problems .
 Bathrooms were also very nice .
 The shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large .
 Then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom .
 The room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom .
 We may have had an ADA room because it was pretty big with large bathroom ,  it was room 459 ,  and the room had all the amenities we were looking for .
The room   and bathroom were perfect in size,  just what is needed .
 The only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room .
 Bathrooms, though, are plenty big .
 Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .
 It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .
 There were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc .
 I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .
 The bathroom was also small  it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !
 Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .
 The bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries   were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle .
 The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .
 The bathroom was clean but a little dated .
 The only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough .
 The bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived .
 Hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it's holder when anyone used the door to our room .
 The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .
 Plenty of room in the bathroom .
 Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .
 The only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting .
 Did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom   .
 Only negative is the bathroom area is a little small .
 Our suite we had was small there was pubic hair on the bathroom floor from  ?
bathroom a little on the older side .
 The bathroom needed a face, lift also .
 The bathrooms are quite small compared to other hotels but adequate .
 The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .

" After I plugged it in to my USB hub on my computer to charge the battery the charging cord design is very clever !
 After you have paged tru a 500, page book one, page, at, a, time to get from Chapter 2 to Chapter 15, see how excited you are about a low battery and all the time it took to get there !
 NO USER REPLACEABLE BATTERY, , Unless you buy the extended warranty for $65 .
 After 1 year you pay $80 plus shipping to send the device to Amazon and have the Kindle REPLACED, not the battery changed out   .
The fact that Kindle 2 has no SD card capability and the battery is not user, serviceable is not an issue with me .
 Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .
 The issue with the battery door opening is thus solved, but Amazon went further, eliminating the door altogether and wrapping the back with sleek stainless steel .
 Frankly, I never used either the card slot or changed the battery on my Kindle 1 but I liked that they were there and I miss them on the Kindle 2, even though, I have to admit, I don't actually need them .
 It's also easy to charge the Kindle in the car if you have a battery charger with a USB port   .
 You can't carry an extra battery ,  though with the extended battery life and extra charging options it's almost a non, issue ,  and you can't replace the battery because of the iPod, like fixed backing .
 For one thing, there's no charge except battery power no pun intended !
 Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .
 As for the battery, Amazon's explanation was that it'd thicken the Kindle, so I'm fine with it b c the slenderness of the K2 is such a plus .
Short battery life ,  I charged this thing for a couple of hours, 24 hours ago ,  it's still running and just at 75% of full power .
 I turned it on, noticed there was about a half a battery charge and proceeded to find my way around the thing .
Fourth, your battery icon stinks .
 It is so subtle that you can't tell how much battery life is left .
Kindle is an  out of the box  reading, ready unit that immediately addressed me by my nickname, no log, in necessary, and could have begun downloading whatever I wanted over the 3G Whispernet within seconds as the battery was charging,
very thin, light, weight, and attractive, looking with more data storage and faster battery charges with longer usage compared to Kindle 1,
What I'm ambivalent about ,  I don't find the battery life any better than the K1, I thought the K1 battery life was perfectly fine .
 extended use of this feature will cut into battery life significantly, I've been getting 2 .
because the battery ran down .
A week ago, I ordered my Kindle 2 and when it was delivered, the battery was in critical stage and it would not power on .
 When that came in, it was also in the critical battery stage and this time the charge light would not even come on upon charging .
 Battery life is very good, even with the wireless on constantly .
 K2 goes into sleep mode if you leave it be for a few minutes, but in this mode it still uses battery power if wireless is enabled .
 Many have been critical of the non user replaceability of the battery .
 I can do without the K2 several years from now for a week while the battery gets replaced .
 More likely, by the time the battery no longer holds a charge, there will be a K7 with a color screen and 200 times the memory that I'll want to upgrade to !
,  Battery life is weeks at a time, even with constant use .
 And the battery life has gotten a lot shorter too, again, after TONS of use .
 which, I guess, is unavoidable with rechargable batteries, but I wish I could change the battery myself .
 The battery was almost fully charged upon receipt so I turned it on and I was in business .
 Good thing the nook boasts a removable back cover, because the store clerk had to take it off to remove the battery for a hard restart .
Battery life is pretty spot on .
 The 2 days battery life was with the wireless turned ON which is wholly unneccesary in the normal operation of the device .
Turn wireless OFF ,  It saves your battery .
 And I like the fact the wireless is a menu option, I just leave it on all the time anyways with little perceptible battery drain .
,  Battery life seems a bit longer but the K1 was good too .
 The Sony takes 60 seconds   to go back to the main menu and used an incrediable amount of battery .
The original Kindle had a removable battery and you could buy extra batteries in case you'd be away from a power source for an extended time .
 The battery in the Kindle 2 is not removable by the owner .
 The Sony is smaller and thinner and, I think, has longer battery life .
 It's not clear how big an advantage it is to have the extra battery life, though, because both get you through a long day with power to spare .
 the screen is small, and the battery doesn't last long enough to be used in the way I use books .
 The battery charged quickly, in less than 2 hours .
 If I didn't have a reading lamp handy, I find that the  Mighty Bright  clip on battery operated book light that amazon .
would no doubt run down the Kindle 2's battery faster .
So far, the battery charge seems to last quite a long time for reading .
 I leave the wireless access feature turned off for longer battery life .
 So far, it has taken anywhere from two to three hours to recharge the device, depending on how far down I've let the battery run .
I'm not pleased with the prospect of having to send the unit in to have the battery replaced when it finally fails and won't take or hold a charge .
 Apparently the Kindle 1 had a battery the owner could replace quickly, the way a cell phone does .
So I give the Kindle 2 an A, minus, the minus because the battery isn't replaceable by the end user .
So my only real complaint right now is a battery the end, user can't replace .
 And the lack of backlight saves on the battery .
 I can leave it on sleep for days and hardly ever need to recharge the battery .
3The battery definitely does not last two weeks on mine .
 With 2, 3 hours of reading per day, my Kindle battery has lasted me only 4 days .
 No idea what battery life is like because I just gave it to her .
>> Better battery life, FAR better with wireless function on .
 To me, this is more important than a user, replaceable battery .
>> It has a user, replaceable battery, though this is offset by improved life with the built, in Kindle 2 battery .
 The battery life is disappointing ,  with the wireless on, it probably wouldn't last 20 hours of determined reading .
 A single battery charge of my Kindle lasts almost two weeks compared to the 3, 4 hours on my iphone or the 5, 6 hours on my netbook .
 Besides, I don't want to make the tradeoff of inferior battery life in order to power a device, native backlight .
 Plus the touch screen consumes battery life .
4,  I like that you can change the battery in the Nook and you can add a memory card .
 However I have IPods and I never use up all the memory or battery life .
 Plus the Kindle 2's Battery life is 4 days longer per charge .
Oh and one more thing ,  I've discovered that if you turn of  wifi    until you know you need to send or retrieve something, the battery lasts for many many more hours .
 A clip, on light seems like a fine solution, plus it doesn't drain the battery .
,  The battery life seems fine to me .
 I left wireless on for the first 3 days, and after reading through  Ur  and 25% of  DaVinci Code , plus lots of general playing around with the device and checking out features, I got the low, battery warning about 55 hours after intially charging it to full .
 This feature uses a lot of battery and the battery lasts for maximum 2, 3 days but it is worth it .
I live in the UK, my Kindle arrived last Thursday and it was up and running in minutes as the battery had some charge when it arrived .
The Kindle does not come with a UK power adaptor, so that has been an extra <U+00A3>12 expense, but I could charge the battery using the computer and USB cable .
 The battery life is unbelievable too .
 Also, I only carried my kindle on the plane to Japan, and I could read for over 15 hours and the battery wasn't even halfway over .
 The books download quickly, the battery lasts a long time, it is simple to use, the bookmark feature is nice, and I love the cool pics on the screen when you turn the gadget off .
 The battery life is great and I even like the screen savers .
 I just found out how to save the battery and you can read for well over a week without a charge .
 If the battery lasts a couple years, not being able to replace it myself will not be a factor either .
 I've left the wireless on and really don't see tremendous battery usage yet .
At first I thought,wait a minute,no memory chip,no exchangeable battery,a few other diff .
It came with battery uncharged, but it charged up as advertised in less than 3 hours .
 And the long battery life is amazing !
 The battery life seems amazing .
 While the Kindle 2 shows the title on the left as before and more readable, the battery life and network icons are in the place of the author's name .
 By the way, Kindle battery lasts forever indeed !

 The Eee Super Hybrid Engine utility lets users overclock or underclock their Eee PC's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .
 A few other things I'd like to point out is that you must push the micro, sized right angle end of the ac adapter until it snaps in place or the battery may not charge .
 In addition the ac adapter does get quite hot while it is actively charging the battery, which Asus clearly mentions in the user manual, so one should not be alarmed over the heat output .

 After you add sales tax, you are then approaching the price of the V series which gets twice the battery life .
 Battery life is one of the biggest features of a netbook so I wouldn't go cheap and get less battery .
Deciding between the V series and the P series really comes done to how much you care about a slight speed different  , a small battery life difference, a better web cam, Bluetooth, and or the netbook sleeve .
,  The best thing about this unit is the battery life .
,  The long life battery makes this unit heavy .
Since the battery life difference is minimum, the only reason to upgrade would be to get the better keyboard .
 For $30, $40 more you get one less usb port, you get covered usb ports which is annoying, and you get less than half the battery life .
 It has the longest battery life of any notebook .
While my 1005HA works like a charm, I personally know several folks that have experienced issues with the battery and or power supply .
Eventually, I noticed that most of these critical reviews referred to the battery or to the charging brick and most of those were describing what could have easily been mistakes made by the owners of the machine .
 They didn't attach the power cord properly or the charging time was too short and some didn't seem to understand how to determine when the battery was fully charged .
 Some complainers faulted the battery life, but didn't take into account what was running or turned on when using the computer .
 The battery is drained more quickly when the computer is operating with all rockets running .
 I suppose that is one reason why I kept gravitating to the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU as I explored the reviews for other brands, , in spite of the warnings about unworkable battery chargers and inoperative batteries I bought the Asus Eee PC .
 The main difference is probably the ten hour battery that is unique and ships with the ASUS Eee PC 1005HA, PU1X, BU .
 I wanted the netbook to use on long airplane flights so the long life battery was a real plus for me .
 The Asus Eee PC is sleek and that big battery doesn't stick out on the back edge like the other netbook high capacity batteries do .
 I like it a lot  the battery and charger problems I feared so much have not materialized .
 I am still a little worried about that battery thing .
 I may have left you with some question about the battery and charging system, , I am sorry about that .
 After almost two months of using my new Eee PC 1005HA I can report no problem with the battery, bringing the battery to a full charge   or the charging brick itself .
 My Jabra bluetooth headset works great with Skype, I've gotten 6 hours on my battery watching movies, listening to music   before plugging it back in .
 Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .
 The backlighting is definitely a factor in the longer battery charge life, but it also makes for a very nice bright picture .
 For the average user the battery charge life will be a plesant surprise .
 faster overall performance, and shorter charge life on the battery .
 When I recently started looking into purchasing a netbook, I was impressed with the battery life of the Asus Eee PC 1000HE .
 When I found out about the Dell Mini 10v coming out, I ordered one with upgrades to a six cell battery and larger hard drive .
 To make a long story short, the track pad buttons   are a nightmare and the battery protruding on the bottom is an ugly compromise .
 Add the high running temperature to the poorer than expected battery life, and the Dell went back .
 The 1008HA was not a consideration because of the non, removable battery and significantly shorter battery life .
 I have not experienced the problems with the battery charger mentioned by other reviewers either .
 The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .
 Battery life continues to hold up and the keyboard is a true godsend with its full size keys .
 The battery life on this thing really is 
, Very sharp, clear image, even with brightness turned down low to get the most from the battery
0 out of 5 stars I wish I had listened to everyone with charging   AC   battery issues !
 the AC charger just stopped charging the battery .
I bought this back in early July and have had NO problems with my battery or charger .
 I haven't drained the battery yet, and I've been coast to coast with it, waits, etc .
 It is a big battery, and it does tend to tip backwards if fully opened and placed on a flat surface .
 Bluetooth narrowed it down, battery life narrowed it further, ability to R&R the memory was a further contraint, and when I was done it was this model or an MSI Wind .
After receiving it in the mail  , I plugged it into the outlet in the living room and allowed the battery to charge .
 Recently, however, my battery was about to die, and I had already set up shop in another room of my house, so I decided to move the power cord to the other room with my computer and let it charge while I worked on it .
 The battery life is quite extensive .
 If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .
 It has a solid feel to it  , but the battery juts out quite a bit, the touchpad keys are terribly placed, the webcam is only 0 .
 Since then, I've used it exclusively on battery power .
 has an 11  screen with the same or better battery life, .
 However, the second time my daughter tried to charge the computer using the supplied battery charger .
 The charger would not operate at all and the computer became useless once the onboard battery ran down .
 With some tweeking, the battery indeed lasted over 10 hours, even while watching hours of  .
 Four hours of solid  on  running through a projector on the battery and still showed 4 hours left on the battery .
5 hour battery is the real deal ,  I had my unit on for 10 hours and it was still running with just over 10% battery capacity remaining .
 The battery power is as advertised which is a main reason I selected this netbook .
 The battery does not protrude and is removeable .
 I think I will love this machine for the purposes I bought it, portability, battery life to carry me through travels and for my teenager to use .
5 battery life was just a claim, but charged at %100 my battery life clocked in 10 .
The battery life on this thing is truly incredible .
 The first day I got it I used it for at least 7 hours and Windows still said it had an hour and a half battery life left before I decided to charge it .
All in all, great product, great battery life .
 This thing has great battery life, fits in the glove box of my car, and serves the uses of a netbook in excellent fashion .
 My only other gripe is the speakers are very weak for media use, but there are pocket, able battery powered speaker options, I am using the Altec Lansing Orbit Altec Lansing iM, 237 Orbit Ultraportable Speaker for MP3 Players  , which is great .
Luckily this thing has a great battery life our I'd be out of luck .
 But the strongest feature to recommend the machine is the battery life .
 I expected six or seven hours in reality, , I'm aware that battery life claims, like MPGs with cars, are usually puffed up .
 If your primary needs are portability and epic battery life, so that you never have to worry about sitting near a power outlet when you're on the go, and you want good construction   then this is the machine for you .
 It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .
 While this is still a fine machine, battery life has started dropping off already .
 My 10, hour battery is now a 7 .
The battery arrived pre, charged .
 When putting the battery on, it nearly doubles the weight of the computer .
 I have been able to make the battery expectancy get up the reported 10 .
0 out of 5 stars Would have been 5 stars except for failed battery and failed ac adapter .
4 PASS ,  Battery life is amazing, used the laptop in  Super Performance Mode  for over 6 hours of watching videos, checking email, connecting with USB Verizon broadband card, and still had battery life leftover .
1 FAIL ,  After one charge cycle, the battery blew a circuit, and would no longer power the netbook .
2 FAIL ,  After three charge cycles, the AC Adapter blew a circuit, and would no longer charge the battery .
 The battery life was the huge selling point for me and it is truly awesome .
 Seriously, I felt extravagant and almost guilty when he noted the 10 hour battery life on my Asus .
 Of course, without the adapter you can't charge the battery or operate the computer .
  the battery life is so good, it was not an issue !
I have had the laptop for 3 weeks now and I have had no trouble with the battery life or the charging process .
9GHz, but it's unstable, and I have actually returned it to stock speeds since the battery life is much better at stock .
The battery life is as advertised here .
 Battery life is the longest of any system I've ever had or seen .
 As for the ac adapter wigging out i've had no such problem as when plugged in it's always on and when on battery it lasts a long time .
Won't send battery without fax letter of agreement .
If we don't get fax no battery .
When might the battery arrive .
Battery is width of 10 pencils .
Will update when battery arrives in a few weeks .
Pro's ,  I so wanted to love the small size, long battery life, brilliant blue color and light weight .
 the battery life is as advertised .
 Battery Life depends on how it's being used   but it's much better than it's little brother the Eee PC 900 .
Well I first ordered this netbook through J&R Music for a good price and when it arrived I charged the battery fully and later turned it on .
 A few hours later the battery light is on and green .
Battery life seems to be good .
0 out of 5 stars Battery problem, August 10, 2009
When received battery defective would not charge .
 After sending Fax and battery at my expense with a time
5 hour battery pack and the 2 GB Crucial upgrade from Amazon after continued delays from Dell on my new Vostro 1520 notebook with Xp .
5 hour battery claim, but it seems to be accurate .
 The wireless networking logs on as soon as the unit is booted, I've had the charger plugged in while cycling the battery and the charger has not quit, the battery life has peaked to the point I can leave this thing on all day without it shutting down .
 I needed something comfortable for typing documents plus something with long battery life to keep in my briefcase .
 I picked it up right away due to the battery life, keyboard and sleek design .
 I actually went without charging it for more than a day because the battery life is just so amazing .
 With such a great battery life, keyboard and responsive touch pad, there's really no other model that can hold a candle to this puppy .
My battery recharger failed within 24 hours, I returned it and received no notification that a replacement was shipped .
3 megapixel camera, the n280 atom processor, a 6, cell battery, and much more .
 I bought this about 3 weeks ago, and just until now, the charger wont completely charge the battery .
 The warranty card plainly states that the warranty covers everything but, the battery or free accessories such as mice or laptop bag .
 The battery is spectacular, and the key board didn't take any time getting used to, and of course it is a very cute cool little gadget .
I had a 2 year old dell that just gave me problems so often, and recently the warrenty went out, coincidentally the battery's connection malfunctioned so it had to stay plugged in and the internet could not be detected, while my parents laptops were fine .
 1005ha has Longer battery life and $30 cheaper, plus people complained about the port covers getting annoying in the 1008 .
 And you can upgrade the ram and remove the battery to be replaced in a few years, or buy another battery to carry around .
 The 1008ha you would have to ship into the Asus company to get a new battery upgrade for ram, which will cost something .
Great battery life, very fast on my wireless router, does websites with flash and other media supported elements and even though I still love my Blackberry I needed something with a bit more  umph  to store vacation pics in on the road and attach files to email .
 Sure this one has a larger battery .
 The keyboard is easy to type on  , the battery life is great, and I've found that I really do like the touch pad with all its features .
 My computer exhibited the precise symptoms described by others, , the first charge, up went fine, but when I had depleted the battery and went to recharge it, the power supply failed to do anything .
, around the house, i can freely roam to wherever i find comfortable or least noisy, NEVER having to worry about the power cord because of the seemingly infinite battery life .
 this thing shines, yet barely sips at the battery
 Full sized laptops are so freaking bulky, heavy, and the battery wouldnt even make it though one of my evening classes .
 Her computer is a top of the line notebook that never leaves her desk because of bulkiness and pathetic battery life, so her only backdrop is the block wall of her dorm XD but with this eeepc, she never sees me in the same place twice, and almost all of the time im outside, far from buildings which really says something about the wireless card .
The reason I went with Asus is the long battery life without the huge bump in the back   ,  a fast processer, easy memory upgrade, good looks and great price .
I bought this to use when traveling within a developing country, where I need lots of battery life and don't feel like lugging around my conspicuous   15  notebook .
Good battery life under Linux about 7 .
 It's bigger, heavier, and has less battery life, but it is much easier to upgrade internal components .
 Its battery life is much longer ,  though not quite the stated 10 .
 The 6, cell lithium, ion battery is seamless integrated into the mainframe to minimize space usage .
 Now add in the N, standard wireless, free netbook sleeve and the usual laptop microphone   webcam suite, and together with its aforementioned compactness and long battery life, it becomes possible to do productive work on the Asus Eee HA1005 ,  maintaining web sites, writing long articles, coding, e, networking, etc ,  almost anywhere .
 The battery life is amazing .
With the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up .
The battery life has not been tested in one complete sitting .
 However, as would be expected, if I tether my cellphone for internet use, it does drain the battery very quickly .
 The use of WIFI also seems to drain the battery, but just not as quickly .
 As far as I can tell, I do not think the battery will last more than six hours for my use .
 I suppose if I turned off the WIFI and Bluetooth and did nothing more than use MS Word, the battery would last longer .
I also noted the charger becomes extremely hot when plugged in and charging the computer battery .
 Long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability .
Charges fully and swiftly,long lasting battery time, functions beautifully .
5 Hour Battery Life, August 7, 2009
 And the battery last only about 7 hours of normal use   .
 Battery life is over 8 hours and I plan to upgrade the memory soon .
 The battery life is excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .
One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .
 1incredible battery life, 2weight  it runs Windows XP not Vista [bleah !
 I do imagine playing games on it would reduce the amount of time on the battery .
 Also, if you're on the web a lot it does take up a little more battery but not enough that you can't still use it most of the day on one charge .
It's incredibly light even with the battery pack in   .
The best part of the 1005HA is that the battery IS user, replaceable .
 I was originally going to buy an ASUS 1000HE but heard the batteries were not user, replaceable, thus you had to send the computer back to ASUS for them to replace the battery with a turn, around time of up to a few months !
The laptop itself is great ,  nice crisp display, great battery life, light, and a nice form factor .
I've run the machine on battery power some four or five times so far and have found no problems with charge or battery power life .
 I spend a lot of time in battery, power environments for other technical devices, so I'm a bit more forgiving when it comes to expected battery life versus real battery life .
0 out of 5 stars netbook with power and battery life, August 24, 2009
 The seashell allows for a big battery .
 I say it's a small price to pay for a sleek and light computer with an incredible battery life .
 After an initial full charging, I ran this netbook to 1% battery life before the first three times I recharged it .
 The adapter that charges the battery overheats really easily .
0 out of 5 stars A great little machine, perfect for travels, though battery life bit shorter than advertised .
 I was looking for portability, light weight, and long battery life, which removed a great many manufacturers off my list .
 When I read the specs and the reviews and the extra hour of battery life for just a few bucks more, my decision was revised .
 I've had the machine for 2 weeks now and the only thing that I'm not very happy with is that the battery power, for me anyway, doesn't last 10 .
5 hours from the battery  I usually get 7 .
 I'm just glad that I didn't buy a machine with slightly less hours of battery life .
If someone is in the market for a great little traveling machine to access the internet, send receive emails, do some writing, and need extended battery life, I highly recommend this Asus eee netbook .
 There are other machines out there, some with identical specs, some similiar, but none match the battery life .
Terrific value at $324 , ,  especially considering the six cell battery !
Some reviewers have complained about the physical size of the battery extrusion from the bottom of the netbook .
 Again, the long, lasting battery makes it worth it .
 Then I switched to battery power and the machine froze .
 When I put back the factory memory the machine worked perfectly on A C and battery .
 Our unit has operated flawlessly so far and the 10 hour battery is a real plus .
 The trick is to fully charge and then fully discharge this battery several times before you start using it in the regular mode .
 Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
 I originally bought the EEE to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere, but have started exclusively using the EEE in place of my laptop because of its portability and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .
 The only minor issue is that the battery life is a bit less after the Windows 7 upgrade .
 What none of the reviews I read told me is that the Asus company recommends that when you are somewhere that has electricity, you should take out the battery and just plug in the machine .
 They said there are only so many recharges in the life of any battery, and when you don't have to use the battery, it extends its life .
One of the reasons I chose this netbook was that the battery does come out ,  my old laptop had an internal battery, and when it stopped taking a charge, I had to replace the whole machine .
 So I decided that whatever I buy has to have a removable battery .
The battery life has been very good, especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth, and turning down the screen brightness .
 This isn't a hassle, and usually when you want extended battery life, you're on a plane where you don't need full brightness or radio anyway .
 Such much lighter and smaller, and compared to the Lenovo, its battery is immortal .
 The battery life is also great ,  I can charge my phone out of the usb port in class and not have to worry about running low on battery before the day is over .
 The battery life is plenty for me .
 I haven't done a real battery test, but I can tell you that it's on all day at work and I don't even bring the power cord from home .
 and I love the battery, life I'm not sure it was 10 .
In terms of battery life its not really 10 .
 I'm glad I did, I charged the battery before attempting anything .
 I mention the battery life which I usually get about 8 hours with full brightness, playing videos or music, and have multiple programs running simultaneously .
 I needed a computer easy to move, to work efficiently and with long battery life and that was precisely what I got .
 This did not affect me much, I can write without problems full university texts, media files run without any problem   and the battery have been used for seven consecutive hours using the computer to the maximum in High Performance Mode without depleted .
 The advantages over Acer and HP are in the best battery and the magnificent instalation that comes with the computer .
 another, i needed one that had a LONG battery life, since it would be a bother to have to charge a netbook every 4, 5 hours .
 Decent speed processor, nice screen quality, great asus softwares  , and very long battery life .
 For those wanting to install Win 7, it works great, no glitches or hiccups, startup is fast, and   less battery loss than vista .
space bar changes battery settings on the ASUS software .
I like Eee 1005PA, V's battery life .
 Keeps it nice and cool and doesn't have a significant effect on the battery .
 The battery life is incredible .
 For another $50, you get a 6 cell battery with 8 hours of run time .
5 hours of battery life, bluetooth, a better webcam can someone confirm this ?
I am a college student that got tired of lugging around a heavy 15inch laptop with less than 3 hours battery life .
The battery life is unbelievable, even while using USB to transfer files, watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up .
 I didn't time it but I got tired of waiting to run down the battery .
 I look forward to having something much lighter and not worrying about when the battery will die .
0 out of 5 stars No issues at all, battery charger works fine .
 My charger battery has never had any problems .
 I carry this netbook in my purse at all times, the long battery lasts as long as described .
The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .
I always dreamed of a PC that has very long battery life
 Has three USB ports on the sides and the back area houses the six cell battery   .
Factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .
 Regarding battery duration I cannot comment on its purpose since whenever I am doing word processing tasks, have always music or videos running .
 And using the two USB port external ASUS disk drive, battery life decreases to only two hours .
 It's battery life and ease of replacement is key .
 I have the $299 version from Best Buy, it has a 3 cell battery with 3hrs of battery operation .
 A 6 cell battery costs over $79 dollars .
 I was skeptical about the long battery life and the cool, touch but I got about 9 .
5hr battery model is going to run a touch heavier than the 6 .
5hr battery models but the extra battery life is really worth it .
 It does not overheat and the battery lasts a long time, not 10 .
 Using a USB mouse lessens the battery time but I LOVE it anyway, it fits into my purse, the colors are great and it is much quicker than my desk top .
The computer will rarely turn on even though the battery has plenty of charge in it .
 The battery life is to die for ,  my full size laptop doesnt have 10
I'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this netbook but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life .
Real world battery life is less than the 10 .
 I usually get 8, 930 hrs of battery while browsing the internet and using office .
Within a few hours of owning this netbook the battery meter stopped working .
 The battery life will ensure that i can go hours without needing a recharge .
 First is the incredible battery life .
 I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .
 Has a very long battery life, runs videos and multimedia smoothly without issues, fast loading, very usable keyboard, stylish sleek design, decent pricing for what you get
The ~10 hour battery life is great .
 Since I have bluetooth and wi, fi on most of the time I actually get about 6~7 hours of battery life .
 The battery power is long lasting, and it serves me well throughout the day .
 1 light weight, 2 long battery life, and 3 reasonable performance .
 Although 1008HA is lighter and thinner, I felt that 1005HA is a better choice for me because of its removable, long battery life and easy RAM access .
 When you start it up for the first time, leave it plugged in ONLY as long as it takes for the battery to charge to full .
 At this point, it is normal for the adapter to become very, very hot while charging all the way from low battery .
If you follow these instructions for several battery cycles, you should find that the charger eventually stops overheating .
And over 9 hours of battery life !
 It has the best battery life out of all the netbooks currently available .
 You have to physically shut, down, unplug, plus remove the battery ,  then restart .
If the ratio of battery, life to cost is important to you ,  this is a decent netbook, except for the inevitable charger failure .
Battery life advertised at 10 .
5 Hour Battery Life to anyone who was looking to make a netbook purchase  Asus seems to have gotten a poor reputation based on their customer service and the faulty power cords they've been sending out, but the netbook itself is a gem .
I love this netbook so far I have not been able to run out of battery 10 .
5 hour battery life is not true ,  if your doing anything other then nothing you will usualy get like 6, 7 hour battery
 Battery performance couldn't be more nice, as well as performance .
 It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .
 Unboxed the netbook, put in the battery, charged it up, everything was great .
 The battery life lasted me about a good 6, 7 hours of e, mail, internet, some MS office work, and watched a video or 2 from streaming Netflix .
Only problem was when I went to recharge my battery for the SECOND TIME EVER OWNING THIS NETBOOK, the power adapter wasn't working .
I bought this netbook and the AC adapter worked fine, but the battery wouldn't charge at all .
 So I exchanged the bad netbook for a new one, but the new one is just like the first  the battery will not charge at all .
 I read the reviews before I first bought this netbook and was aware that there was an issue with the battery .
 Extra long battery life ,  pretty accurate specs given
5 Hour Battery Life was the one that caught my eye .
 Obviously ,  the battery drained out within hours .
 Battery life is longer than I had expected obviously 10 .
 And even better, has a built in webcam, an impeccable battery life, a great touch pad and exceptionally ergonomic design .
 Battery life around 6 hours playing games or DVIX videos which in my book is simply awesome !
 Love the LED backlight concept which saves battery life and you don't have to worry about the flourescent bulbs fading after a few years   .
 Now I keep battery topped off or charge when not in use and no longer seems to be a problem .
This netbook has plenty of power for my needs and the battery life is great .
Been very pleased with performance and battery life, however power supply went out after 60 days .
0 out of 5 stars Initially battery problems , ,  however now it works, December 22, 2009
In the mean time I let the battery go down completely  turned out the battery would not charge, even though Windows XP was reporting it was .
when experiencing charging problems, let the battery go out completely .
 Noticed that the battery indicator started flashing orange, instead a steady orange .
After 3 hrs the battery was fully charged, unplugged the netbook, started up Windows, and the battery indicator showed about 10 hours charge remaining .
The battery life is pretty good though the trackpad is annoying .
what i loved is the battery  :
 The battery's longevity is amazing I get around 
 it is designed to be as small as possible, and the long, life battery on the back end makes it tipsy .
 Excellent battery life, small and light enough to drop in a handbag and forget it's there .
 I tug it around for all my personal stuff and it is light, easy to carry   and I really do get 10 hours plus use of the battery .
The battery on my netbook lasts almost 13 hours since I keep the LCD brightness relatively low .
 It has the fastest processor currently available  , huge battery, life 10 .
I bought this although I already have a Sony Vaio for its light weight and long battery life .
 Indeed it runs as fast as advertised and battery life is excellent .
The most impressive on this is the battery life :
The battery life is incredible .
 I spent a bit of time researching the various netbooks currently available and thought that the 1005HA, P had a nice mix of style, battery life, ergonomics, and performance   .
 I have found the actual battery life to be around 8 hours   .
 The main selling point for this netbook is its amazing battery life .
 The battery doesn't add much bulk to the overall unit at all either .
For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .
 I haven't put it to the test on how long it actually lasts, but I use it off and on all day and I've never had the battery go dead on me .
The long battery life is on and off .
 Sometimes it says that I have 70% battery life AND 3hrs :
 Saying that, I don't have any battery saving settings set as I'm not too familiar with that and haven't had the need .
 The sound wasn't all that great but hooking up some battery op speakers or headphones would be the way to go there .
 The battery life last almost 4 hours with contine use but I have the battery charger that charges in no time .
 I can easily get 8 hours on the battery life while running multiple programs and listening to music over the wireless internet .
 I have not tried running the battery out quickly or seeing if I can shut things down to get the full 10 .
 The image is nice and crisp and the longevity of the battery is a definite plus .
The battery life has been amazing so far .
 Very lightweight and portable and the battery life is outstanding .
 I took this on a trip and the battery lasted about 6 hours   before showing it was at 53% .
 The computer is quite fast and the battery is amazing .
 Much to my surprise I was shocked at how well it performed, especially the battery .
5 hour battery life is really helpful .
5 hour battery life is great .
 It looks good, is very sleek and stylish, very light and gives around 9, 10 hrs battery backup on 1 charge .
 I am very pleased and would recommend it anyone that wants something very portable with great battery life .
Battery life is great and it seems to charge fast as well .
 On top of that, ASUS tech support reports that the brick is out of stock and will not be available for 2 weeks and my battery is completely dead .
 As a backup I purchased a second battery .
 Key features in my decision were b,g, & n wireless, built in bluetooth mouse capability, and the best in class battery life .
 I bought this to take notes in college classes, so battery life was very important to me and it did not disappoint .
 With the very first charge, I got nearly 10 hours of battery life .
 The battery life is not its promised 10 .
0 out of 5 stars Good ergonomics, exceptional battery, performance meets expectations .
 Pretty standard list of specs for a netbook with the addition of bluetooth and a very long battery life .
 The long battery life is awesome !
 The battery is INFINITELY better, and I can easily squeeze 10 hours out of it if I need to .
 When I learned about the battery life, the memory, hard drive, processor, etc .

"I thought it would be fitting to christen my Kindle with the Stephen King novella UR, so went to the Amazon site on my computer and clicked on the button to buy it .
 As soon as I'd clicked the button to confirm my order it appeared on my Kindle almost immediately !
After reading through the introductory guide that loads up automatically at the start and following along it took me almost no time to learn which buttons are where and what each of them do .
 I started reading with the default size without my glasses and noticed I was squinting a bit, so changed to one size larger with a couple button clicks and it was much easier without feeling like the print was too big and took up too much of the page .
 The gadget feeling is underlined by needing to press a button to turn pages .
It took very little time to get used to having to push a button to turn pages and the screen flash as they turn only really startled me the first few times .
 I don't feel the need to push the button ahead of time to prepare for the end of the page at all, which evidently a lot of Kindle 1 owners do since it's a bit more sluggish .
 unintended page changes, the awkward way I sometimes have to hold it to keep from hitting buttons, the sometimes slow page refresh, and the screen freezes that now has me traveling with a paper clip lest I need to do a reset while commuting on the train .
 No longer do I have to press and hold two buttons to put the device to sleep .
 the button hinges are on the outside ,  at the edge ,  of the K2 .
 You need to press on the interior of the button to get it to click .
 Combine that with the smaller button sizes and one major source of frustration has been instantly eliminated !
 The little power button at the top of the Kindle is really a power slide .
 The change in the hinging and size of the buttons is major plus and would make it hard to go back to the K1 .
 sleeker look and feel  , sharper screen, no longer accidentally depressing the next page button by accident and having to find your place in the book again .
,  The 5, way button, though a bit small, allows you to select left and right, and not just up and down like the original version .
 Only issue is I need to recalibrate now, , in general, I try to anticipate how much time it will take the next page to load, and when I'm two lines from the bottom, I would hit the next page button .
 Now I need to push the button later .
 That 5, way button is magical .
The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .
 I like to read holding the Kindle with one hand and it just didn't work well because I kept bumping the next, previous and back buttons .
 The display is better and the 5, way button is a major improvement .
 On off buttons are repositioned to be easily accessible .
 Things like the buttons that made it easy to accidentally turn pages  the separate cursor on the side that could only select lines and was sometimes hard to see  the occasionally awkward menus  the case which practically forced you to remove it to use it and sometimes pulled the battery door off .
 The second thing is the buttons .
 This means that when you handle the Kindle 2 by the edges, the pages don't change even if you grab by the buttons .
 Yet changing pages is effortless when you do ,  the buttons are right between your thumbs and the slightest pressure on their faces is enough to activate them .
 That it doesn't have the quirky, clunky, annoying buttons that filled <U+00BE> of each side of its predecessor, buttons that caused dozens upon dozens of accidental page turns makes it that much sexier .
What I like most about the Kindle 2 is the placement of the buttons and their inversion .
 It has the feel of the mouse button in the middle of a laptop keyboard and I never liked those .
 Manipulating that button reminded me of something I'd rather not think about when trying to get work done .
 if you don't upgrade, you will regret it every time you accidentally hit one of the obscenely large buttons and advance or retreat one, two, three, or even four pages .
 The page turn buttons are better .
 With the Kindle 1, I was constantly at risk of accidentally bumping the next page buttons .
 With the Kindle 2, the buttons have been scaled down to a much more manageable size and are a lot less sensitive .
 I love the 4, way directional button .
 It took a little getting used to after having used the Kindle 1, especially since the context menus that I was used to in the first gen have changed due to the new directional button, but for any Kindle user, this change is a god send .
 It looks good, feels good in the hand, has good buttons, which are easy to operate on purpose but not so easy accidentally .
 A button click brings up the dictionary, starting with that entry .
It's very easy to page forward or backward through the text with the dedicated buttons .
 The button layout looks odd because it's so regularly spaced in rows versus the keyboard's staggered style, but it isn't any harder to use than a cellphone's tri, letter entry or blackberry keyboard .
 The buttons are not hard to press at all .
 Every K2 button has a satisfying 
 Just like how I prefer to grasp the page a few sentences before the end of a page, I tend to press the  Next Page  button a bit sooner than I finish reading the page .
 The lag actually helps in that respect, and even so, the lag between pushing the button and the new page appearing is much faster than I could ever physically flip any book page without shearing it from the spine .
,  Inside, edge buttons ,  These have saved me from accidentally pressing buttons many times .
 The text is darker and clearer and the buttons are more like the Sony , ,  both on one side   .
 when I received my Kindle 2 I was very impressed with the design, especially the improved button design .
Tiny buttons with even tinier text on the buttons .
The incredibly tiny buttons are literally impossible for people with low, vision to read .
 And the tiny buttons with the even tinier text ?
Greatly improved page turning buttons .
 The codes vary depending on which button I press and the most recent code has been 90UGC .
Each time this has happened, I have contacted the support team, each time the team member has made me delete the book from the device,they've resent it to me and I've had to do the hold the power button for 20 seconds process each time .
I'm not crazy about the way that the scroll button works either .
 The buttons and the controller work smoothly .
 Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .
 I love how the content manager is better integrated and I don't have to hit so many buttons to manage my books .
What I hate ,  I hate the new button positioning .
 Since the K2 is longer and the buttons are near the bottom, its awkward to hold and feels unbalanced in my hands, almost like it will tip over .
 When I'm trying to go to the next page, I hit the home button by accident a lot .
 I also hate the fact that you really have to push the buttons hard to change the page .
 I really liked the extra responsiveness of the K1 buttons   .
 However I was disappointed to discover that I was unable to press the buttons from that position .
 With the K2 I can turn on the TTS feature with one button, place it beside me, and have it read to me all night !
I contemplated changes to my beloved Kindle with dread, I was one of the few who loved the old page, turning buttons .
 I worried that the new buttons would be Sony Reader size, and impossible for me to press .
 Thankfully the buttons are still at least thumb, size, and may appear hard to press, until you realize that they are hinged on the inside .
 I like the new size and feel of the buttons .
 It is much harder now to accidentally hit the page buttons .
 But holding the darn thing was a chore without pressing that next button page .
 Kind of hard to do when you're inadvertently pressing buttons .
 Also the keyboard has been redesigned to make things easier as well as added buttons like  menu  which is nice .
 I find myself using a large size typeface to compensate for the lack of contrast, but this means frequent  next page  button presses which is extremely annoying .
 The buttons have a cheap feel .
 The  next page  buttons should activate when pressed at any angle .
 Upgrade the quality of the hardware especially the buttons .
 You can pretty much figure everything out by just trying the buttons .
The next, previous, back buttons are much smaller and are hard to hit accidentally .
The keyboard buttons are small, round, low, profile and have slightly convex tops .
The on, off button is now on top and the radio on, off switch is now in a software menu .
The Kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .
 My thanks to  Arts&HistoryFan  for pointing out that when you hit the menu button, the time is shown in the top banner .
 Yes, I noticed some of the initial design flaws in the first, generation Kindle ,  the placement of the  next page  buttons, the general sense of flimsiness ,  but I decided I could live with those .
 Opened the box, press the button and it begins downloading books that I pre, ordered .
 The welcome screen comes on to explain all the buttons .
 One thing I didn't like was the page next button failed to work when the text to speech was in use and I wanted to skip ahead .
 sym button depressed at same time
 Buttons are accessible, raised for convenience of all involved ,  another big plus for the visually impaired or those with other conditions .
 The sound button is raised only slightly ,  fine for VI but potentially problematic for those with arthritis or other issues with fine motor function as it is a relatively thin button that must be pressed slightly .
The buttons are well placed and need a good push to change pages, but not so much that it detracts from your reading .
Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .
 I miss having a dedicated button to deactivate the wireess, but the overall device has improved so much that I will get over the loss quickly .
Buttons are not hard to press for me .
 They do require a bit of pressure, but I like it that way so I can rest my thumbs on the buttons without turning the page accidentally .
 They seem to be in the perfect location, I can grip the K2 easily and do not have to worry about pressing a button on accident but when I need to change the page they are right where I want them .
 Moving the cursor to the word in question can be a bit awkward since there is some delay using the 5 direction button, but it's not so awkward as to not use the feature .
 Getting a free sample wirelessly and then just hitting a button to buy it is great .
 I hate tiny gadgets with tiny screens covered with tiny buttons that lead to a labyrinth of tiny submenus filled with nonsensical options .
 Click a button and it's there in seconds .
 The buttons have been made smaller, which fixed the large buttons on the lst generation that made the device hard to hold and frustratingly easy to advance the page .
,  One button to turn on, turn off, and sleep .
 I also like the fact the button is on the top and not on the back as it was on the K1 .
 I just have to use the new five way button to highlight the word and look up shows at the bottom without leaving the page .
significant improvement over Kindle 1's non intuitive forward and previous buttons .
 Also I'm afraid that overusing the mouse button may cause it to wear out quickly .
 If you wish to go back say a dozen pages to look up something you simply have to press the 'previous page' button 12 times in succession .
 Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .
 My mother, in, law has enough difficulty with her fingers and the tiny buttons that she generally uses a pencil, eraser to push the buttons .
 When you look at it, if you don't focus too hard, the little buttons and controls fade away and all you see is the text .
 The only thing you can do is rotate, which makes some PDFs readable but then you're in the awkward position of having to press the next and previous page buttons vertically instead of horizontally .
 One day while laying on the couch reading I pressed the 'next page' button and the screen went blank .
 While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .
 My one complaint is that I'd like a  previous page  button on both side of the screen, the way there's a  next page  button on both sides, but that's a very minor consideration .
 Reading the book in the cover isn't a problem as the front cover readily folds around to the back so that it isn't making the left, edge buttons hard to press .
 To use the  enter  function, that is to execute a command or enter the text I've typed in, I just have to push downward on the square button .
The prev next back home buttons are too small ?
 Add a prev page button on the right and a home button on the left .
Next page and other buttons ,  very easy to use .
 The buttons really are much better .
I also found using the navigation button difficult .
 The size and buttons are fine with me .
 The new navigation button works well, and the keyboard   feels good to my fingers .
 The buttons are also laid out and I'm so glad they put the  Next  buttons on both sides since it makes it so easy to use .
 The Qwerty keyboard, while the buttons are small, is spaced nicely for ease of use .
 I find the Kindle buttons perfect for this type of device .
I find the buttons easy to use .
,  I find the myriad of buttons on the face of the device to be very nicely done .
 As highly documented before, the buttons on the side of the device used for page turning, going to the home screen, and accessing the menu all engage with an inward click .
 This enables you to pick up the device with the edges without pressing any buttons .
 They buttons are well placed .
 The page turning buttons are a lot easier to hit than say, flipping a page in a real book while lying in bed, having said page get caught up on the covers, and having to adjust to get it squared away .
 The major buttons on both sides are for the next page .
 For some reason, my brain wants a prior page button on the left side and the next page button on the right .
 I hit the page button once and looked left as though I had turned an actual page in a book .
A minor grumble, I keep wanting to press Next Page rather than the select button to make things happen .
 Its the position of the buttons that seems to make me want to do that .
 I intuitively want the biggest button to be 'select' rather than Next Page .
 Your finger can rest on the  next page  button, and a simple click is all you need to advance .
 When you hold it in the opposite hand, the next page button is on the other side too .
 I don't need two hands to hold the book open when I'm on the train, or whenever, just one hand gives you good access to all the buttons even while you are holding the device .
 I also love the fact they made the next and previous page buttons a little bit harder to push so I am not constantly pressing buttons I don't mean to .
 The buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively .
, new buttons are a massive step up .
 You can hold the buttons on the edge and not turn pages .
 There is a feeling of strength to the thumb buttons, they are not oversensitive like the old ones, and the keyboard is a great improvement over those odd keys on the K1 .
My only fear is that I will wear out my 5 direction menu button within the month,  since there is SO much to see, do and find
 Just hit the enter button on the keyboard, and it takes you directly to the full dictionary entry, complete with pronunciation guide .
 The buttons are placed in a convenient area without being in the way, yet turning a page is a breeze .
 Previous button presses inward, toward the screen, while other buttons press toward the outside edges .
 All of the controls and buttons are well placed and easy to understand .
The redesign of the buttons is a great improvement .
When I purchased the Kindle originally, I had several issues with the physical layout, the inability to stop the  accidental  button pushing and the sharp corners .
In the Kindle 2, the corners have been rounded and the buttons have been restructured so that it takes a little pressure to press inward instead of outward .
The placement of the on off button is much better at the top rather than the back as previously .
 I really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .
 The buttons rubbed the fingers at the bottom .
 On the Kindle 2, the button has been moved to the top right side of the device .
The keyboard buttons are smaller and also require some pressure to activate .
 What remains to be seen, however, is whether the Kindle 2 will be plagued with having to be reset as frequently as the Kindle, nor did I see a reset button .
 I love the  next page  button on both sides of the Kindle 2 .
 The buttons on the K2 are not easily pressed while reading, and I love the 5, way button that allows me to easily navigate between my newpaper pages   .
 I flicked the switch to start reading, and the screen froze with a bunch of lines on it that would flicker a bit when I hit a button, but that was all .
There is no 1, 800 number for Canada for Kindle support, so you request them to call you via a button on their site .
 I hit the button, bent over to plug in the Kindle, and the phone rang before I straightened up .

 My conclusion after doing a ton of research regarding safety, reliability, comfort and gas mileage :
 the Hyundai Sonata is thousands of dollars cheaper and matches the Camry in all respects except comfort .

 While the '03 was roomy and comfortable, the steering and handling were very vague .
 The interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .

" You also get upscale features like spoken directions including street names and programmable POIs .
 I used to hesitate to go out of my directions but not any more .
 the directions didn't tell me anything I didn't already know after fiddling with it for 10 minutes .
 It also does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .
 It gives your heading not in terms of degres but only in terms of one of eight directions   .
The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .
Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .
 While I recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, I note that some of the more impressive features of this GPS are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .
 But leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .
 I've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .
 but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .
Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .
I like how the Garmin 255W doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .
The only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the Garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .
 No more firing up the computer, going to the site, printing the directions .
 It speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .
 It allows for detours with directions on how to get back .
 Saves mobile phone minutes, because you don't have to call and ask for directions .
Traffic directions are as good and detailed as can be, as you would expect from a Garmin, and less intrusive than on some other brands .
In closing, this is a fantastic GPS with some very nice features and is very accurate in directions .
 The sound is tolerable, but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot, it gets really annoying .
 However, the TTS gave me few wrong directions during my trip to NY city .
0 out of 5 stars gives strange directions, July 6, 2009
 The directions are highly accurate down to a  T  .
 Depending on what you are using it for, it is a nice adjunct to a travel trip and the directions are accurate and usually the quickest, but not always .
 I tend to be a technological idiot but I figure this out, right out of the box and I hadn't even read the directions yet, , this is major easy .
 Gives you immediate directions to get to the location you chose to set up as your home location .
 Allows you to type in two street names, and if they intersect, the GPS unit will give you directions to that intersection .
 You can touch anywhere on the map and press GO for directions to that location .
 Shows you your current latitude and longitude location, and allows you to enter new coordinates to set up so you can get directions to that location .
 If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .
 However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .
Some of the verbal directions :
 It should tell me to take the Southwest Drive exit, or the Buffalo Gap Road exit, like the highway sign says, or like I would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .
 So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .
Directions seemed to focus on Interstate travel and I have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid Interstates .
It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .
Directions were easy to see and understand .
 The spoken directions are generally easy to understand .
 Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .
 It does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .
 The spoken turn, by, turn directions are clear and very timely .
 My only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the Garmin routing feature that you can sync between your PC and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'A' to point 'B' directions system .
 You can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and Google Maps has features that work with Garmin units .
 Any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .
 button, and it gave us directions right to Carmel .
  The purpose of the GPS is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .
The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .
It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .
 I had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown Sacramento .
As with the 285WT, it gave me bad directions in one place in Sacramento .
 I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .
I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .
 It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .
 Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .
 The directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .
 I am sure I've not even touched upon the many features this GPS boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .
 My daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping Web site and recite the directions .
 Daughter Dearest now carries the Nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .
 When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .
 There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .
 I mainly bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .
 It worked so well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .
 In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .
 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .
 Amazon had the best price for this model which I chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .
For the first time in several years, my husband & I took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .
 Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .
 It has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .
 I was so tired of having to go to Mapquest and print out directions .
 The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .
What the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .
 I would have struggled to find with my usual combination of maps and Web, based directions .
 The directions the GPS gave me were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .
 Wish I had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of ME .
 I spent 2 weeks driving around the Mid, West following Mapquest maps and directions .
 I chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .
 I use the map feature when I don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .
On the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .
0 out of 5 stars MyOn, StarDirectionsReplacementUnit, October 15, 2009
My new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .
 This unit has replaced my GM On, Star Directions unit in my vehicle .
 directions routing are perfect .
 spoken directions are crystal clear .
 Practiced visiting places I already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .
 The directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .
 No more stopping at so and so gas stations for directions .
 Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .
 It can be a little distracting the first few times you use it, but once you find the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there waiting for you to with all the directions to get you to your destination .
 I had no trouble with the volume level of the spoken directions either and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool .
 Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .
After a certain amount of frustration dealing with paper maps, missed exits and fumbling for directions in the dark ,  I decided it was time to get on the GPS car navigation wagon .
 Also, there is there no asking for directions from passengers like spouses and children who have difficulty reading conventional paper maps .
Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .
 It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .
 But driving on the highway with music on and windows down, it will be hard to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .
 I didnt know the address of the mueseum so I typed it into the unit and it found not only the meuseum, but the nearest garage, the places to eat, and directions were right ON .
The display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .
 The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .
","directions_garmin_nuvi_255W_gps","The voice directions are good, it sometime wrongly pronounce them but its understandable.

"3 quot  widescreen display was a bonus .
 This made for smoother graphics on the 255w of the vehicle moving along displayed roads, where the 750's display was more of a  jerky  movement .
 I also found that the display on the 255w was a bit brighter, clearer, and more vivid than on the 750 in both daylight and at night .
 The 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow .
 The 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .
Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .
The 255W has a really clear display that's easy to see in any light .
 The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .
 The widescreen display makes it possible to view the names of roads that you are passing on the screen, , which makes it much easier to differentiate between which road to turn on when there are two streets on your right   that are only one house apart .
The bad ,  My unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .
UPDATE ON THIS ,  It finally turned out that to see the elevation contours at lower zoom levels   you have to reduce the amount of detail displayed .
 I also miss the display of how far you have yet to go on your route .
 My old unit counts this down for you and provides an estimate of ETA on the map display .
 I have to hit too many buttons to get back to the map display when, for example, I am entering POIs .
 Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
 In the map view, if you touch the display button to the left of the  Menu  button  , it brings up a display that features some stats about your trip and includes a compass of sorts .
 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .
 For me, the visual display combined with this level of verbal instruction is just right .
So I finally got the Nuvi 255w after months of analizing and comparing wit other brands, adding 3 days of looking arownd in Circuit City and Best Buy stores displays .
 It also can display and speak many languages .
 I am thinking about buying another one of these for my parents because their native language is Chinese and Garmin 255W speaks and display it !
 The display is great, and is very clear .
 The instructions sometimes are a little difficult to understand, but written at the top of the display is the next turn information .
 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .
 Through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .
 The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .
 Since the directions are also displayed on the screen, I find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .
 I have checked the display in three areas I am familiar with :
 But is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .
 Even setting the display to maximum detail is far from adequate .
 I have really sensitive eyes and sometimes the display is too much, but there is an adjustment for it .
The display is extremely legible both in bright sunlight and at night .
 I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .
,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .
The unit speaks street names, has a beautiful display and a very intuitive interface .
 Also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .
 I also like the way the display changes background color for day and night and of course you have control of that as well .
 I thought I had seen a turn by turn display but if you pick a location and wait at the GO icon you will see a Route Info slide out but it just tells you the distance and time, though if you tap on it it will show the map so you can zoom around and see the trip as it planned it .
 Well when I saw that the 255W had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner I jumped at it .
The Garmin has a nice 3d display .
One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .
 I like the larger display and quicker updating of maps .
 I really like the versatility of picking destination points either by inputing an explicit address, uploading from Google Maps, or just touching a point on the display .
The display is bright & clear in the car .
 The display is laid out better than the 660 .
 It is very easy to use, and when driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from Kms to Miles .
it should have the names of streets written down on the display roads as you pass them .
The display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .
 The new speed limit display on the 205 255 is quite helpful .
 The sound went out on it and only the display worked .

 The dream has always been a portable electronic device that could hold a ton of reading material, automate subscriptions and facilitate quick easy downloads, and be as portable, as easy on the eyes, and as intuitive as a book .
  they would ask, to which I would squint my eyes and reply,  Huh ?

 No having to turn away every few minutes to relax your eyes  or ending a session of reading with a headache .
,  E, ink and matte screen ,  No harsh computer, screen look to it does not fatigue my eyes at all, and the matte helps reduce glare from light bulbs and the sun .
 My eyesight is fine, but I can choose the font size that suits me best .
'Easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink :
 I noticed this almost immediately but thought it was due to my poor eyesight .
 I can read technical books without any problems but I cannot read text on the Kindle without straining my eyes .
 I was starry eyed in anticipation of the newest addition to our family .
 The text clarity and screen sharpness of K2 is severely disappointing and produces eye fatigue .
 I had old favorites, and some classics that we're told we should read, samples that had caught my eye, and lots of new choices , ,  and I held them all in my hand .
I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .
 And with the Kindle, I can adjust the font to any of six different sizes, which is of some importance to those with poor vision or tired eyes .
 The text is easy on my eyes .
 For me, it was no problem at all, no eye strain after reading for a few hours .
 I know some people are really upset about the no backlight issue, but I'm glad because it is not as straining on my eyes as a computer screen .
 I read for 2 hours in the middle of the night last night and my husband never knew, and my eyes didn't hurt .
 Text to speech is adequate, I don't see myself using this feature too much, but it's a lot better than nothing when you need both hands free, and it would be a truly fantastic feature for anyone with poor eyesight or blindness .
,  The screen is easy on the eyes .
 The screen is amazing & the one thing that kept me from reading on into the night constantly eyestrain is NO LONGER a CONCERN !
 I don't care it doesn't have a backlight ,  if I wanted that I'd read from my laptop and kill my eyes more .
 This thing is so easy on the eyes, I like it better than an actual book .
0 out of 5 stars A great tool for those of us with aging eyes, February 28, 2009
 The text, bumped up two magnification levels, is sharp and clear enough for me to make out, and while I've seen some criticism of the gray page background, I actually find it easier on my eyes than stark white .
 For those of us in the Boomer bulge whose eyesight is failing and taking with it the pleasure of reading ,  and for those with other forms of visual impairment ,  it's nothing less than a miracle .
 As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .
 I am loving the whole concept and read almost a whole book last night with no eye strain at all .
I have been keeping an eye on the Kindle since the first was brought out and did a lot of research on this product .
and that is why it's easy on the eyes and uses very little power .
 I use that as well when it gets late and my eyes tire .
 The lights are casted from the side of the reader fusing towards the center, which caused me to experience severe eye, strain .
 Even without the back light, within fifteen minutes of reading on the sony reader due to the glare, my eyes were hurting .
  I have not experienced eye, strain .
 The illuminence of the light is equally distributed onto the screen which causes  no  eye strain .
 Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .
 And reading on the Kindle screen really is pleasant and natural, not to mention that my 47 year old eyes love the possibility of adjusting the text size  !
First of all, the Kindle 2 is very easy on the eyes .
Some have said they don't like the black text on a greyish background, but I find the contrast not only more than adequate but easier on the eyes than if the background were white .
 A backlighted display is not easy on the eyes for hours on end and the Kindle 2 display is as nice to read as any traditional book .
 I won't be using the feature much anyway because I get a lot more out of a book I'm reading with my eyes and hearing the voice of the storyteller in my mind .
 It's easier on the eyes not to have that light .
 It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .
 E, ink hardly strains your eyes .
 Truly, this helps in my eyes .
 Easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !
 Not having your eyeballs scorched, seared and scarred by the traditional computer screen is really nice .
 With the great technology of electronic ink, there isn't any back, lighting pounding relentlessly like the desert sun on your tender eyes .
 This means you can read for longer periods of time without eyestrain .
 The screen is so easy on the eyes .
 The Kindle does not have a screen that taxes the eyes, and allows me to shift some of my time away from the computer for blogs that I would normally read online .
 It's lightweight and allows changes in font size that enables ease of reading no matter how tired your eyes may get .
I do think the e, ink e, paper is a lot easier on my eyes for reading than the glossy or matte computer screens .
 The screen size is close enough to the size of a paperback book page that it hasn't caused my eyes any problems .
 It looks very much like a book and is easy on the eyes .
8 E, Ink display is easy to read and doesn't strain your eyes and reads better than a printed page .
 I can strain to read the text but then close my eye for awhile and listen .
,  Eye strain is completely non, existant in my experience .
 I would like to read on the way but my eyes get strained if I read on a bus .
 It is also very easy on the eyes .
I can make the font the perfect size for my eyes .
 Although I'm turning pages quicker, my eyes are much less tired by using a bigger font .
The screen is less obtrusive than the white of a book page, which also helps my eyes from growing tired too quickly .
I finally got the Kindle, and my worries about the screen tiring my eyes while reading rapidly dissipated .
 It's easy on the eyes   and easy to hold .
I am 71 years old and read at least one or two books per week and this reader is easy on the eyes .
 Searching for books and downloading them is fast and easy, the screen is very easy on the eyes .
 Unfortunately my wife lost about 50 percent of her eyesight ten years ago and has not been able to enjoy reading since then .
 Adding one for  free  to the Kindle2 is just pulling wool over your eyes .
 As it gets lateI simply pump up the character size which eases tired eyes .
 Now with the Kindle 2, I can change the print to suit my eyes and further, I can make more intelligent choices of books because I have more information of what is available at my finger tips .
 I am amazed at how easy the E Ink is on the eyes, the slight shadowing from page to page does not bother me .
 The screen is easy on the eyes, easy to learn, easy to turn pages, and the device is more comfortable than a real book or trying to hold the iphone .
 The print is easy on the eye and the light weight of the device and easy to use controls make reading even more of a joy !
 The Text, to, Speech function is great for times when my hands and eyes busy with other tasks .
 I have an  eye issue  and noticed it was getting harder to read books .
 I enjoy having the text at the largest size because there is less eyestrain .
 The e ink is so comfortable on the eyes .

 This review briefly touches upon some of the key features and enhancements of Microsoft's latest OS .
 All of these features combine to create a much improved and enjoyable desktop experience .
I enjoyed the new convenience features in Windows 7 .
 They showed me PC laptops that had more features than the MacBook, and which cost way less than the MacBook, too .
 But that aside, I like the availability of software, the new features like the improved Taskbar, Windows Peek, and the Aero environment .
If you're used to OS X, but want to come into the PC world where things cost less and you get more features, by all means consider Windows 7 the stepping stone to do just that .
 After seeing the pricing on the newest MacBooks this week, and the limited features compared to what I currently own, I have to say that now is the right time to consider that switch to PC .
 These new features make the user experience much more superior than anything Windows has ever offered .
 Also there are some other new things such as touch gesture features and disk encryption that normal users won't use either because it isn't needed or the hardware isn't widely adopted yet   .
 You can read all the new features in your Windows 7 short version handbook .
 But what I really like about Windows 7 are the new and improved features it offers .
Also in Windows Explorer, two new features .
All the nifty new features mean squat if my computers don't function properly .
, then Vista, but if so, none of its features have been impressive enough to have blown me away .
 It does have some nice features .
 W7 is fast and resource friendly, every hardware device works perfect  , and there's a ton of great features .
 Runs well, but no stand out new features for my usage .
Having used Windows ME and XP for several years, and before upgrading, Vista, I heard a lot of great things about Windows 7, as well as new features .
 I liked the built, in features of Vista and of course the appearance, but I prefered the stability and speed of XP even with a high, end system .
,  Better user interface features like being able to view the desktop with one mouse gesture to the bottom right of the screen .
LEAST useful features of Windows 7 to me :
 They're features I don't use .
 Windows 7 Ultimate is there too off course, but I personally can't bring myself to spend that much more money just to get a tiny few features that I know I will never use like multi, language support and BitLocker .
 It's loaded with useful features .
 It has some features that I personally don't find useful, BUT if in the future I do need them, they're there .
 There are many features that allow me to personalize my working environment .
   Vista has more features than XP, but many of them didn't make the OS more usable for me .
 Personally I thought Vista was very handsome, what with its transparency, 3, D effects, color schemes, and usability improvements to Windows Explorer, and I believe Windows 7 continues that trend by looking just as sexy , ,  if not more , ,  while at the same time adding its own valuable features and enhancements .
 I haven't yet become accustomed to some features like Aero Shake, but hey, those things are there if I need them .
I can't tell what positives it offers still, but it's still a nifty upgrade with a lot of nifty features over XP that make for a more fun experience for some, and a more organized experience involving navigating huge catacombs of archives and files .
 Did I mention that Win7 offers nothing in terms of any new worthwhile features ?
0 out of 5 stars XP speed & stability, Vista, like features without the headaches !
 I really wanted to like Vista with all it's cool new features, but unfortunately it was a disaster because it just didn't work .
 And I love all the new Aero Shake Peek Snap windows features, but I still prefer Mac OS X's Expose .
,  New features with better window and file managment
,  Many features are copied from Mac OS X
 Of course there are some new features, and a little more eye candy if that's important to you too .
 Nice upgrade and love some of the new features, snip tool, sticky's on the desktop, Docking on the task bar and thanks for clearing the clutter on the Tray .
 W7 has some cool features that I like, and I'm sure I don't even know the half of it yet .
 I don't have a TV Tuner, so I can't take advantage of that feature, but there are other features & it seems to be working good .
00 dollars just to upgrade for some fancy new features .
 Since my Google Sidebar had some features that I liked, it allowed me to replace it for the Windows one .
 Because others on this site have already described in sufficient detail all the amazing features of W7, I will not repeat them .
 There are so many more features of this that are very difficult to list all here .
 All   of these features have worked 100% of the time, which is previously unheard of .
 Removing a  feature  from the Programs and Features panel simply disables access to it, but the underlying program files associated with that feature remain on the hard, drive taking up space .
 I also noticed improved power management, including once of my favorite features which is the auto dimming of my laptop monitors once my computer is not being used .
All the features of Vista, but without any of the problems .
 It still works pretty good though, just a lack of some features that i had before .
 What I will highlight are a few features of Windows 7 which I have been thoroughly impressed with .
 Perhaps my expectations were low, since Microsoft OSes tend usually to be just functional   without much pizazz or many  power user  shortcuts and features, but Windows 7 really is a well, crafted OS .
 I do not use most of the features, such as gaming, that seem to benefit most from the upgrade .
Does the new operating system have cool features ?
 My only complaint would be that I would like to have a family pack available in the Windows Professional flavor or at least the option to purchase some of the professional features separately .
 Seems like they actually stepped it down when it should have been stepped up with more features .
 I think the reason it didn't is because it wants to force the user to use the Windows Live toolbar that includes other features similar to what Google offers .
Smooth OS with great little features .
 A lot of the new finder desktop windows features are awkward working versions of what Mac OS X has had for a couple of years or more .
 If you didn't come over from the bright side you would probably think these features are very cool, so enjoy them for what they are if you've never played around with a Mac enough to be comfortable in that environment .
 I am not going to review the features, because there's plenty of that already .
There is not a lot of new features in the operating system .
","features_windows7","Has a lot of great little features that seem to work without problems.","Good new features but similar to Mac OS.","Good new features but similar to Mac OS.","Window7 has many new features which make the PC more advanced and user-friendly than the earlier models.",NA
"Being able to change the font sizes is awesome !
 For whatever reason, Amazon decided to make the Font on the Home Screen   than on the K1 .
 I found myself constantly changing the angle of the body, changing the font size up and down and the distance away from me .
 I was an avid reader but increasing age has made printed books more of a challenge, but the Kindle with its varying font size and very light weight has made reading fun again .
 What's more, it's easy to change font size .
 The kindle does not recognize page numbers, since they would change radically when you change font size  so Amazon provides the notion of location which is display independent .
 I just crank the font up a notch or two and leave the readers behind .
 My eyesight is fine, but I can choose the font size that suits me best .
'Easy, on, the, eyes' reading with adjustable fonts and 16 shades of gray capability using digital ink :
Maximum font size is still not big enough for people with vision problems .
 One or two larger font sizes would have benefited the visually impaired .
 Downloading books is easy, the screen is NOT too dark, the font size is adjustable and the Kindle customer service support is terrific .
I know I need to go to the optometrist, but the Kindle will aide and abet me in avoiding that for a while , ,  the page is easy to read, the font size is easy to change, and my eyes sail across the words, my finger hits next page without me giving it thought .
 The text appears slightly blurry and I have to increase the font size to read it comfortably .
 And with the Kindle, I can adjust the font to any of six different sizes, which is of some importance to those with poor vision or tired eyes .
 The font is clear and adjustable in size .
 While they may not reproduce the look of a printed page, applications for these devices, such as ereader, do offer a variety of font types, background colors, and page turning mechanisms, the ability to read in either vertical or horizontal mode, and the ability to make the text scroll on the page, like a teleprompter, at a speed of your choosing .
 The E, Ink screen is so much better than I thought and yes, I've read about the concerns people have raised about the Kindle screen and its fonts .
 Sleek style, easy to hold, the white causes it to disappear as suggested in its description, highly transportable, well thought out button placement, easy to use, adjustable font, ease of downloading new books .
 With good lighting   it is very readable and the adjustable font makes up for this shortcoming .
Dictionary entries are now shown in your currently selected font size .
 High, contrast e, ink, downloadable content, variable font size, integrated dictionary, integrated search .
 With six font sizes, even the visually impaired could benefit from this feature .
 Aa keys to quickly change font size, turning on off text to speech, Pause text to speech, change speech rate and speaking voice rather than using the menu .
The font sizes are easy to switch between and very usable .
 As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .
 Very accessible and friendly for those with a visual impairment ,  all raised keys, font sizing, text to voice .
azw you can change the font size of the document without the  .
azw conversion the pdf will usually have teeny tiny unreadable font, this solves that, text to speech it, etc .
 Due to being able to change the font it is also difficult to be able to read this for a class and reference page numbers from an actual book, but a search function that regular books , don't',  have more than makes up for this .
 Being able to change your font size is really nice as well, but I keep mine at the lowest so I don't have to turn pages so often .
The font size options include a slightly smaller font that before, , looks great .
 I use the second smallest font 90% of the time and I do find I need a little extra light where I wouldn't have when reading a normal book .
 I also really enjoy the ability to change font sizes, they are pretty close to large print books .
 As I get sleepier, I like to enlarge the font, which is a nice feature .
 Seemed like the perfect thing for an ex, avid reader, since you can change font size, have it read to you, download newspapers and magazines, and you don't have to drive to the book store or library !
 The clarity of the screen makes even the smallest font readable .
 Using the smaller font sizes causes eye strain except in daylight conditions with open windows .
 The print appears faded especially with the smaller font sizes .
 This allows only about 2 paragraphs of text to be visualised at a time at medium font size .
 I have changed the font size so that it is so easy to see .
 A couple of books I've purchased aren't great, fontwise .
 Most books, however, are very easy to read, and the variable font size enables me to find the font size that works best for me .
 While not as much text fits on a screen as on a mass, market paperback page using the font size I like, pushing the  next page  button has become second nature .
 It's also easy to make the font larger whenever necessary, like when my eyes are tired .
1All the fonts look exactly the same, regardless of the book .
 Easy on the eyes, font size can be changed and the book will even read to you if you want it too !
 It's lightweight and allows changes in font size that enables ease of reading no matter how tired your eyes may get .
 I also like that the amount of whitespace   as well as font size on, screen is configurable .
 I can still make out words with the use of strong glasses and setting the font to the largest possible on the Kindle2 .
 I like the small size, the grey colour background is relaxing, and its good to be able to change the size of the font .
I can make the font the perfect size for my eyes .
 Although I'm turning pages quicker, my eyes are much less tired by using a bigger font .
 It is quick and responsive and reading from the default font is easy .
 Because of the ability to change the font size on the KINDLE she was able to once again start reading a book .
 Everyone looking into the Kindle has probably heard about the font smoothing contrast issue which is exacerbated by the bright whiteness of the unit's housing .
 However, just last night, I ran across a couple of user fixes for the font smoothing problem, and I've already put a  skin  on mine so that the contrast between the ePaper display's gray background and the  frame's  white is no longer an issue .
 I have a bit of macular degeneration, and when reading the Kindle, for some reason, that little blurry spot does not show up, and this is at a small font .
The Kindle 2 is lightweight, easy to hold, easy to read, and I love the fact that I can change the size of the font, depending on my situation .
 I am in my 50's and the reading vision isn't great so changing the font is a blessing .
 The interface is a bit like reading newsprint, though you can change the font size to 6 or 8 different settings .
 It is so much easier to read than a paper page and you can adjust the font size as needed .
it's just like reading a paper book, but BETTER because you can increase the font size !
font sizes and page orientation can be adapted to the reader's needs .

" The room was packed to capacity with queues at the food buffets .
 The over zealous   staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .
 There are a couple pubs, a great patisserie and even fast food restaurants within a block .
The neighborhood is an upscale residential area full of restaurants in easy walking distance ranging from  fast food  to up, scale with a wide variety of cuisines , ,  we never had a bad meal .
The food   was wonderful, a selection of sandwiches, salads, cous cous and spicy wedge potato's, fruit salad and a cake was a good fill up when needed .
Full English breakfast was included in our rate and was very good indeed ,  staff were busy clearing tables promptly and fresh food kept arriving all the time .
 One local restaurant stood out for having excellent food,  Olives  located one block away .
,  Great location  ,  Very good selection of food for breakfast buffet .
 I can't see what sets it apart from other 3, star hotels I've stayed in ,  other than the fact it's in London, in a posh area and has good food .
 We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .
 There are plenty of restaurants in the area as well, including fast food joints and two small, ish supermarkets .
 They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .
 Breakfast equally tired ,  although a reasonable selection of food, general ambience in restaurant more like a youth hostel .
 The breakfast buffet full English breakfast was fantastic with a very good selection of food .
really nice hotel for buissnessnot much around in terms of shoppin etcfood was ok
Everything about this hotel was first class including the food !
 The nicest surprise was how fantastic the food was which I hadn't expected in a large chain hotel .
 It is very convenient to the Gloucester Road tube stop, grocery store, drug store and fast food places .
 I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .
 The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .
 Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .
 There was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .
 There were Italian, Indian, British, American fast food, and Thai restaurants very close to the hotel on Cromwell   Gloucester Rds .
Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a <U+00A3>6 .
   You could buy food from Sainsburys or Waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .
 Food Drink a little pricey in local establishments .
95 if you want hot food as well .
 Note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .
 We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .
 There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .
 Not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !
 There is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .
 Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .
There is a grocery store close by that you can pick up food and a Starbucks nearby .
 As mentioned, there are several places to buy food if you're going cheap :
The hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a Waitrose , Tesco and various Fast Food joints and restaurants nearby .
 Shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .
The food is very, very good   and the staff were very friendly .
 The hotel itself was very pleasant ,  the staff friendly and helpful and I can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .
 The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .
 The food is excellent and the service great .
 The bar food actually looked pretty inviting as it passed by .
 If you like Indian food we ate at the Dehli Brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced .
 I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .
 You can buy drinks and breakfast food at a Waitrose supermarket and Tesso express mart next door .
 The area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of Indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .
 Within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the Tube Station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet Restautants, Pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !
 as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .
We ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .
 The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .
 When the food arrive   it was the wrong order .
 I can also tell you that there is nothing fantastic about the food .
 While travelling out of London to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive .
 The rooms have never disappointed and the food is always nice .
 Breakfast was OK, great choice, but the cooked food was a bit tepid .
 The area is really safe with great food, boots, tesco, waitrose   burger king, kfc and starbucks .
Additionally, they recommended the Cafe Forum which was about two blocks from the hotel for breakfast, the prices were reasonable and food was excellent .
00, good quality food, lots of choice, continental, full english, hot and fresh, very friendly staffs .
 There is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .
 Many hotels I have stayed in the food has been rarely hot .
 The bed was very comfortable, and the empty refrigerator was a great place to store food and beverages .
 Within easy reach you have all you could want peaceful areas and shops and food outlets .
 I can't comment on any of the hotel restaurants or food as we never ate there with so many other choices nearby .
 Avoid the food in the hotel restaurant as it is ridiculously overpriced .
 Also there is a nice bistro around the corner with very good food that is moderately priced .
The food here is great, we had breakfast brought to our room, although pricy well worth it .
 Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .
Would not recommend the Patisserie food looked overpriced, pastries were dry !
 Food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .
there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !
 More than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .
 Another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from Waitrose .
 they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from sandwhiches to desserts at a fraction of the cost .
The food in the restaurant is terrible .
 Both of these offer good variety of good food at very reasonable prices and suitable for children .
 The Glouster Road tube station is just two minutes away, along with other food stores, pubs, internet cafes, restaurants etc .
 Its a chain but the food was cheap and delicious !
 Stunning food, amazing service .
 We didn't eat at the hotel ,  there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price .
 If you're a family vacation traveller, you'll probably make use of the grocery store often becuse food in London is expensive when you consider the terrible USD, GPB exchange rate .
 Many restaurants in the neighborhood, ranging from swanky to fast food to haute cuisine .
 There are coffee and pastry shops around the corner and fast food .
 There is also a grocery store in a shopping plaza on the corner where you can buy take out food, wine, etc .
 It was in a fantastic position, one block to the Gloucester Road tube station    there's a supermarket and fast food shops, as well as other shops nearby and opposite the station .
 But it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again .
 Food was OK, service very haphazard .
 The range of food available would have satirfied anyone, all well cooked and efficiently replenished .
I didn't sample any of the food options but there are several outlets just around the hotel .
The huge coffe bar in the lobby is quite nice and offers drinks and food at good prices .
 The Delhi Brasserie restaurant recommended by the hotel's concierge was a short walk, the food delicious and reasonable .
 The food was good and the service was very good .
 Additionally, there are numerous restaurants everywhere ranging from fast food to upscale .
 There was also a more expensive English breakfast with many hot foods which was included in some room prices .
 The frig doesn<U+0092>t keep items cold enough for food safety <U+0096> it<U+0092>s merely to slightly chill .
The Waitrose Market sells yummy food .
I want close proximity to tube station, starbucks, and food .
 Food was expensive, but that is true all over London just now .
 The Waitrose supermarket has many take out food options .
Another reviewer mentioned the smell of food on the 25th floor .
 Very convenient, but don't stay on that floor as the smell of heating food wafts down the corridor .
 The best food deal in this area is the local grocery store down the street ,  get your breakfast and lunch here and dine out nightly .
 One block from the tube, half a block from a nice grocery store for essentials like bottled water, snacks and takeaway prepared food, tissues, etc .
 Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .
The food in their pub as far as sandwiches etc, was reasonable .
 Food in Pub is excellent value .
 All the 4 nights we stayed there we relished the hot Indian food takeout from the WaitRose grocery chain, which is just around the corner .
 Really good Indian food is just a few blocks away .
There is an Internet cafe, laundramat and Sainsbury grocery store to the left up Cromwell Road and fast food, Banks   and post offices to the right down Cromwell road .
 It is in a nice neighborhood with fast food, resturants, and shopping with in walking distance .
 because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .
 The food was delicious in both the Consortia and Forum restaurants in the hotel .
","food_holiday_inn_london","Food was excellent with a wide range of choices and good services.
It was a bit expensive though.","Food can be a little bit overpriced, but is good for a hotel.","The food in the hotel was a little over priced but excellent in taste and choice.
There were also many choices to eat in the near vicinity of the hotel.","The food is good, the service great.

" The food for our event was delicious .
 The food in the lounge was great and very fresh, , , salads, sandwiches etc .
 As far as food, walk a few blocks toward Michigan Ave turn left or right and there are plently of less expensive places to eat .
 The Palm resturant in the hotel had some specials Sunday night, we ate there and the food service,etc were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big eaters .
 Took the charge of the minibar which we had used to keep my 2 year old sons food .
 We never ate anything onsite so I can't vouch for the food options immediately avialable .
 The Lobby bar does not serve food very late at night and we couldn't find any vending machines for soda or snacks, so stop at a nearby market before going in for the night .
 In any case, I had allotted approximately $150 for <U+0093>food<U+0094> for 4 days 3 nights .
 But the presentation was awesome and the food was so good and not having to walk in the dark at night and scare my mother or pay for a taxi or bus, but sit around and eat comfortably in my pajamas was well worth the cost to me .
 The food was delicious and the view was fabulous .
 For self catering types, Bockwinkels is a well stocked mini grocery 2 blocks south and 1 block east on street level for snacks, drinks and all kinds of deli prepared foods, plus the Aon Center's underground food court 2 blocks south and 2 .
 Room service was extortionate though, very very expensive, so we didnt bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .
 We also did the chicago food tasting tour which you can find here on travelzoo, this was fantastic and well worth the $40 pp .
 So if you move around bottles in the fridge so that you can store your own food personal items, the sensor will send a signal to the hotel and you will be charged .
 We passed on the restaurants simply because the cost of breakfast was insane and the food tends to be mediocre .
 Also don't forget to go the &quot The River North&quot  for great food .
 An added bonus was the Executive Lounge with complimentary food throughout the day .
 Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .
 there is a market one block south of the Hyatt that has wine beer and food for reasonable prices until 2am, and a Dominick's   grocery store across the river open til 1am .
 Had an appetizer at the Lobby Lounge, and the food came from the Palm Restaurant .
 The hotel buffet had fabulous food .
 I didn't dine in the hotel, so I can't tell you about the food .
 We enjoyed the breakfast although the other evening food service was a bit skimpy .
 Room service got my breakfast order wrong but they made it up the next day when I ordered a kids meal and got enough food for three people .
 I was delighted as the waiters were very friendly and the seafood was delicious .
 mile with traditional Italian food and a great atmosphere .
 A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food .
 Good but pricey food, great breakfast .
 My only complaint is the Palm restaurant, it is expensive and the food not very good .
 If you want good food at a decent price, there is a restaurant called Houlihan's down the street from the hotel on Wacker St .
 We ordered room service for late night ice cream and fruit and also breakfast and it was prompt and very excellent food .
Ed Debevics is fun, , sassy servers, diner food, total check about $30 for all four of us .
Brain Food Cafe in the museum of Science and Industry, , sounds crazy I know but it was the best museum food ever .
 No line, a plate full of REAL food with drink included for $7 each .
Staying with food, try also the Weber Grill, N .
The few complaints I had were as follows ,  refrigerator was stocked with food that was weight sensitive .
 But the food was good and fresh .
 Very friendly servers and nice selection of food at a reasonable price .
 We called several times and within 30 minutes our food was at the door .
 The Italian food was superb .
 My wife and I are food snobs, and this place really was a treat .
 Very much enjoyed the Chicago Food Tour, a walking tour that incorporates food tastings at various places like a bakery, traditional deli, pizza, chocolate lounge, etc .
 Room service was efficient, average priced, and decent food .
 I ate their last night and the food and service were top noch .
I had a great experience here from the quality of the lobby, to the quality of the room, to the view, to the room service, to the food .
 The hotel is advertised to have multiple restaurants, but that was not the case either , ,  other than room service the only option for dinner is The Palms restaurant which is very overpriced for the quality of the food .
 There's an escalator that goes into the basement where you'll find a nice upscale restaurant and a long walkway concourse that leads to an underground mini, mall, with a grocery store, fast, food restaurants, barber shop etc .
, followed shortly thereafter by a knock and a housekeeper telling us our sign wasn't out  the hotel's extremely limited cable service    our housekeeper didn't refill replace our shampoo or shower gel our entire stay, nor did she empty all of our trash bins at any one time  our room service on two occasions brought us cold soggy, , and very late, , food  the lobby bar closes at 9 p .
 Food unexceptional although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant   was of good quality .
 We were able to get a crib, a play pen, and a small room refrigerator for storing baby food at NO additional cost .
 The food at the Swissotel is better than the average hotel but nothing special .

 As said before, the free wine reception in the evening is Two Buck Chuck, drinkable, but certainly not anything to write home about .
 The free wine tasting every night was a wonderful extra and welcomed relaxment in between a long day of sightseeing and evenings out .
 That and also the free coffee and tea   every morning were little extras that we felt made you feel like a welcomed guest and that they are going out of their way to make the hotel special .
 Free internet in the lobby but none of any sort in the rooms .
The hotel lobby was lovely, real fire, large comfy chairs and free internet access in the corner .

 I personally appreciated the free internet service in the hotel .
 Free internet and a computer for use in the lobby was helpful .
 The manager's cocktail hour was a nice touch, and the free coffee in the morning was also nice though I had to ask both mornings for hot chocolate to be brought out for the kids, and the advertised biscotti was no where to be found .
 I didn't get to take advantage of the free coffee in the morning, but my husband and I did go to the 5pm, 6pm cocktail hour, which we enjoyed .
 Coffee and biscotti were available in reception every morning free of charge or if you preferred, there was a restaurant in the hotel that served breakfast or a Starbucks round the corner .

 We did however take advantage of the free coffee and biscotti that was offered every morning in the lobby .
No bar as such in the hotel but they have free wine tasting every day at 5p .
The free wine beer and coffee hot chocolate biscotti is a wonderful touch and we took full advantage of it .
 The late afternoon free wine reception was a really nice touch and we enjoyed this very much .
 Although we didn't use it, there was free Internet access in the room .
l also enjoyed the morning coffee in the lobby and the free wine .
 The lobby area was really pleasant and the free wine   gets you talking to other guests .
The free morning hot cocoa and coffee was nice before our daily excursions .
 The afternoon wine and cheese was a nice bonus as was the free Internet .
 We were surprised and delighted when, on arrival, we were given tokens for free continental breakasts .

 The free morning coffee is also well appreciated and attended .
 The free drinks are great if you and like the feeling of getting something for nothing .

 Then we picked up the free lobby coffee and the WSJ and the USA Today newspapers, thus having a cheap breakfast .
 We particularly enjoyed the nightly 'manager's reception' when wine and nibbles are freely available !
 The nightly free wine reception is a great way to meet people and find out what is worth seeing and what is not .
Free Wireless internet access .
 Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .
 The staff were friendly and the free coffee and biscoti each morning and wine at 6pm each evening were occassions when one could meet other guests .
The hotel provides free hot drinks and biscotti in the mornings, which was good quality but why ?
 Free wine and mingle from 5 to 6pm .
 It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .
 There was a free wine tasting that the hotel put on that we were, unfortunately, too jet, lagged to participate in .
 Every evening 5pm to 6pm, guests are invited to have free wine in the reception area and there is free coffee there every morning .
 The hotel's evening wine hour and morning's biscotti hour also distinguish the property as a cut above, and our group, which has stayed at many a biz hotel, had no problem whatsoever  in fact, a courtesy upgrade got us a fine meeting space with free internet, which even impressed our boss .
The great thing for us was the free parking .
We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .

 Refrigerator, minibar, free wifi, iron   board, hairdryer, down comforters   and pillow top beds .

 Free coffee in the morning, free beer and wine in the afternoon, what more could you ask for ?

 The free wine in the lounge each evening was very nice, and given with good grace ,  even the fourth glass !
 Coffee and hot chocolate were also available free from 6am each morning, although there was also a coffee maker in the room .
 The only criticism I have is that there was no safe in the room, although safety deposit boxes were available free of charge in reception .
 The rest of the immediate neighborhood seemed safe and nondescript, and largely free of the homeless and the street people that are in evidence elsewhere in this costly city .
A complete disappointment ,  from losing the reservation made through Best Western toll, free number   to charging our credit card for someone elses stay 3 WEEKS AFTER WE LEFT !
 Dont let the &quot free&quot  wine and biscotti fool you .
 The free beer, wine etc and snacks on an afternoon was a lovely touch and helped you swap tips and chat to other guests .

I had read a prior review complaning about the fact the hotel had run out of the &quot free&quot  morning biscotti's as promised to quests .

 Guests actually talk to one another during morning coffee, and the free hour of wine at 5 pm .

 The use of the foyer for free drinks between 5, 6pm was popular especially with fellow Brits !

Everything about our stay at Best Western, Tuscan Inn was great, location to the wharf, cable cars and everything we wanted to see and do .

the tuscan inn has a good location, within easy walking distance to the wharf .
We loved the location, , easy walking distance to the wharf and cable cars .
00, however that being said if you are used to staying at true Kimpton hotels this will leave you wanting, but again location and price makes this a great hotel, the wine they serve is 2 buck chuck get there early if you want to partake, there were people everywhere waiting for the pourings, so we decided to skip out on this one

A good location if you want to be walking distance to sights and transportation .
 The location is great, I opted for a Fisherman's wharf stay for vacation having stayed near Union square on business in the past and I'm glad I did as it was easy walking distance to Chinatown and the touristy area of the wharf .
Location of the hotel was ideal to explore the know attractions, with just a 2 min walk to the wharf   ferries and the famous cable cars, which transported you to union square  lombard st etc .
 The location is ideal but the car park is really expensive, so if you are ending a trip here, take your hire car back after you have unloaded your luggage and get a taxi to the airport .
This hotel is in a perfect location .
The Tuscan Inn was in a great location a few minutes from Fisherman's Wharf .
 We have now stayed in three hotels in Fisherman's Wharf but the Tuscan Inn represents a good comprise of location, cost and facilities .
 The location only 2 blocks from Fisherman's Wharf made it a perfect base for exploring the area, we were able to walk or take public transportation everywhere we went .
Great location to Fishermans Wharf .
 My boyfriend's first response was &quot wow, this is a tiny room&quot , but it was what I was expecting considering the location and that this is only a 3, star property .
Location ,  This is the best part of the hotel .
 The hotel is also very noisy but I guess this is inevitable considering the location .
 If you want to be near Fishermans Wharf the location is great .

This was my 9th trip to San Francisco but unlike prior trips I was with my in, laws and had different criteria for the trip, they wanted to be close to all the Fisherman<U+0092>s Wharf action and walking distance to the main tourist attractions, this hotel was ideal and the best value we could find in the location .

 The Tuscan Inn is in a great location in Fishermen's Wharf and our boys really enjoyed Pier 39 .
Great location clean rooms we enjoyed our visit .
 We were a little disappointed with the location of this hotel as although it is close to Fisherman's Wharf   Pier 39, it wasn't very busy in the nearby streets so we didn't feel like lingering in the restaurants before returning at night .
 The location is excellent for access to the cable cars and the wharf .
Great location for San Francisco sightseeing
 The location of this hotel is great if you are there to enjoy the tourist stuff of SF .

It's in a good location by Fisherman's Wharf Pier 39 .
 The location is great and accessible to all parts of the city by bus, cable car or the &quot F&quot  train .
 Great location in Fishermans Wharf .
 This hotel can trade on its location which, although a rather ugly and unappealing area full of tacky tourist shops, predictable chain restaurants and large number of tour groups, is an excellent base to explore the city .
The Best Western Tuscan Inn is at the perfect location in San Francisco .
 The location was excellent for the Whalf attractions including cruises and Tram bus tours and for the cable car into Union square .

Great location thought I had seen everything
 The best part of the hotel was its location .
 Exellent location for Pier39, Fishermans wharf and trams etc, with a large Safeway a block away .

 Overall, though, a great location if you want to be near the Wharf .
Would definately recommend this hotal as the location is perfect , only afew blocks from Fishermans Wharf .
 Great location near Fisherman's Wharf and a great price for a suite albeit not a huge one !
The Fisherman's Wharf location is a bit over the top touristy .
not to mention perfect location !

 If you want to stay near the Wharf this is a good location  .
 The location is great since it is only a couple blocks to Fisherman's Wharf, the ferry for Alcatraz, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Square, cable cars, bus stops, and there is a small shopping center across the street with grocery store, etc .
 If you're traveling to SF for the first time and have kids with you I think this is a perfect location .

The location was good if you want to be near Fisherman's Wharf .

 Our travel agent, Terri, suggested this place and said it had a great location and cozier feel than some other hotels .
 The hotel is in the perfect location for Fishermans Wharf and the best activity in San Francisco BIKE THE BRIDGE .
 The location of the hotel is very good .
 Ask to see a few rooms before you check in, because the room size and location can vary between floors and sides .
 All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .
good location but ask for a room away from the road
good location, close to fishermans wharf, pier 39, ghiradaelli square and cable car stops to union square .
 And the location is perfect for tourists .
Although there is no pool or fitness facility at location, as others have mentioned, passes are available at the front desk for $9 day for the 24 hour facility right across the street that has both gym equipment and a pool .

 I continue to find BW's in unique places with good property locations .
 Can't beat location, Mason and North Point .

The Tuscan Inn is in a great location, 2 blocks from the wharf, a block from the cable car, a block from the F, Line, opposite a Safeway, and next door to a nice Italian restaurant .

Great Hotel in a Great Location
 The location of the hotel is excellent ,  only a few minutes walk from the cable car terminal and adjoined by a large Barnes and Noble bookstore with Starbucks for whiling away any spare moments !
The room had a few annoying decorative items , ,  like a four, foot long round pillow carefully placed at the same location on the bed by the maid every day , ,  that seemed spawned by a marketing maven .
 Other than the small room, the location was great and very close to all the attractions of Fisherman's Wharf .
Perfect Location Priced A Little High
 The location is terrific ,  two blocks from Fisherman's Wharf .
It is a 2 block walk to the wharf and the location is very convenient .

 The location was perfect, we could go anywhere and still feel close .
 It is in a great location, the staff is always alert and courteous, the rooms are clean, the morning coffee and biscotti are a nice touch, the happy hour is a PLUS, and the price is right  !
I planned a weekend getaway and thought because of the location and Hotel chain we would receive good service .
 If you get a cheap rate here, have low expectations and are sound sleepers, then this is good for location to Fisherman's Wharf attractions .
 Nice, medium sized hotel in a good location .
This hotel is in a great location in terms of a walking distance to key Fisherman's Wharf attractions .
The location is excellent right in the centre of fishermans wharf, a few minutes walk to all the major attractions and cable car .
 The staff at check, in were nice enough, but unfortunately the concierge was not very helpful, giving us wrong information about our car hire location causing us to get 2 cab rides instead of one .
 Good value hotel for the location .
 The location of the hotel was fantastic it takes a couple of minutes to walk to pier 39 and is right next to the tram stop to take you into the main shopping areas .
 We would recommend this location for anyone who wanted to be close to all attractions .

 The only good hting was the location .
Got to hotel, disappointed in the incredibly small rooms, but location is great .
PROSThe location is wonderful .
Overall though, the location was great and the hotel was nice .
 It is in a great location, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the managers wine hour is a welcome bonus .
You also can't beat the Tuscan Inn for location .
Great location at a reasonable price
 The hotel location was great .
 The location is great, if your an active person you can walk everywhere from this hotel, in fact we took a long run up the shore , , crissy field and accross the golden gate bridge .

 Lovely hotel and excellent location .
 Overall though a top hotel in an excellent location .
 We thought the location was excellent, , attractions in San Francisco are not all in one spot, so no hotel will be adjacent to everything you want to see .
Nice hotel close to the action  however, I did not like the location ,  while it was close to the Wharf, the area of the hotel was seedy .
 The location could NOT be better ,  we were 2 blocks from the Wharf !

 Yes, the rooms were small for the money paid but the location was wonderful .
OK hotel,very small and tight room, nice lobby and good location if you want to be by all the tourists that get drawn to the wharf, the best part of the hotel,  the restaurant downstairs on the corner, a little pricey but good breakfeasts and dinners .

" Great location for tube and we crammed in a fair amount of sightseeing in a short time .
All in all, a normal chain hotel on a nice location  , I will be back if I do not find anthing closer to Picadilly for a better price .
Great Price Terrific Location .
The location is absolutely wonderful .
Our main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location .
Very Good Value ,  Excellent Location .
 The location is ideal for travel all over the city via the Underground .
Excellent hotel in prime location .
Good Location Horrible Service Disgusting Procedures .
First and foremost, the good, yes it has good location, a block away from Gloucester Road Tube Station .
 The convenient location and competitive rates finally sold us on a repeat visit .
The location of this hotel is it's best feature ,  two blocks from the tube on lines that run to most major attractions .
The saving grace of this hotel, is the friendly staff and its location in Kensington .
The positives were the location, a block from the Gloucster Rd .
 The public areas are fine if bland, the rooms comfortable if slightly cramped, the location good for tube and bus but just a little 'distant' .
Its saving grace is its location .
 The location is excellent ,  near to the Tube and walking distance of a lot of attractions .
 Turned out to be this excellent property in a prime location .
 Location could not have been better with the Gloucester Road tube station just a few minutes' walk from the hotel .
 Bottom line is that I would definitely return to this property for its comfort and convenient location .
Great Location clean good place to stay !
 Overall, I would recommend this hotel to friends, and would probably stay here again, because it was such a great location and clean .
 Even better is the hotel's location ,  literally a two, minute walk around the corner and you're at the Gloucester Road Tube Station and a host of small shops, pubs and eateries .
Great stay friendly service great location .
 I would say this is a better than standard HI and the location just can't be beat .
 I am giving a 'very good' based on staff, rates,and location .
 We liked the location and decided to stay again .
 The location close to a tube station and a grocery store is ideal .
average hotel in a good location .
This hotel is in a good location .
 If you want a reasonably priced place to stay in London in a convenient location, then this is a good choice !
Excellent Hotel Excellent location Would definately stay again !
In London its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place ,  The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum did that for me and I couldn't ask for more .
 It's rated 4, stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3, star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .
great hotel in a lovely location .
 Excellent location next to Gloucester Road tube station that has 3 train lines making getting around London really easy .
Good location one excellent concierge but problems .
 The location of the hotel is really good .
Great Location for Sightseeing .
Efficient hotel with a good location .
 The location is a block away from the underground station on the Picadilly Line direct from Heathrow Airport .
Excellent Hotel ,  Great Location .
Good Location New Room Bad Service  .
The hotel was a great location just 1 block from Tube, Grocery Stores, Pharmacy and 2 blocks from Natural History and Victoria   Albert Museums .
Convenient location not 4, star room and services but OK .
Great location but definitely NOT a 4 star hotel .
LOCATION ,  this hotel is located around the block from the Gloucester tube station   and a few ATM machines .
Great location but is it really 4 star ?
,  Great location  ,  Very good selection of food for breakfast buffet .
 The location was only a five minute walk from the Gloucester Road Tube stop .
 Great location, near Gloucester Road tube station, handy cluster of cafes, shops, couple of pubs, plus supermarket in the station complex .
 For the price and location, this was a very great hotel .
Good location clean and comfortable .
Great location but not sure it's worth the money .
 What you are really paying for at this hotel is location and in hotel restaurants .
 Fantastic location very close to the tube and buses .
 It was a pretty good value and in a good location .
 We wanted something more spacious, but this hotel had extremely convenient location and good reviews, so we decided to stay there .
 The positives, great location, just a few minutes from a tube station which makes touring easy and with a travelcard taking midday breaks is easy .
Apart from the location, the hotel was really not up to standard .
 It is a great location, the rooms are a bit basic, but clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time .
excellent location friendly staff .
went for a city break with the family hotel good location harrods 20 mins walk,royal albert hall 10 mins,and under ground around the corner,plenty to see and do around hotel .
 One good aspect of this hotel was the location, it is about 2 blocks to the tube station, shopping and eating .
 Not too easy to find rooms for more than two people in London unless you compromise on a few things, such as cost, location etc .
Location is not very good since one has to travel by tube to shop or sightsee .
 The location to the Gloucester Road tube station was very handy .
 We chose it due to its location i .
Great location for first time traveller .
 When I approached one stewardess, she assured me that her airline used Holiday Inn Kensington Forum on a regular basis because of its location .
Hotel was super average nothing great about it at all except the location .
Since everyone starts with the good that I agree with ,  great location, very clean, I'll state the not, so good .
 One of the best features of this hotel is the LOCATION .
 The hotel's location is perfect for sightseeing and shopping   and the Tube .
Location great but hotel dated .
Tower block hotel in fantastic location near good shops, bars and restaurants .
 The positives about the place are the views from the windows if you have an upper floor room, and the location next to Gloucester Road tube station and a small shopping area .
 For a little extra money, the soon to be Crowne Plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location
Nice hotel with great location for transportation .
We've stayed at this hotel before and it's always been a great choice for it's location, cleanliness and staff .
 very good location, next to underground station, very near to city center .
Convenient location Great Concierge service .
 It isn't the most central location but I found it easy enough to get into London .
 I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .
Great location and above average rooms .
 For the price and the location I thought this place was great .
 The location is just around the corner from the tube, Boots and Waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .
 Its location is probably the first thing worth mentioning, being a 10 minutes walk from the natural history museum, a 15 minutes walk from beautiful Hyde Park and just behind the corner of the Gloucester Road underground station   .
 Even otherwise, no matter if it's going to cost you a bit more, I'd still recommend it, considering its location and overall standards .
 There was a lot of road noise, but this is only to be expected, given the location .
Location is great, 5 mins walk to the Natural History Museum, 15 to Kensington High St and 2 mins to the tube and in a high room you can see for miles   .
Location was excellent with close proximity to tube station We will definitely stau here again , good value
Great location for the tube and bus !
Also it is perfect for the Gloucester Road tube station with direct trains to Heathrow airport terminals,very good location turn right as you exit the station the hotels a 3 minute walk on your right hand side .
 Location is very close to Gloucester Road Tube so easy to get into central london for the tourist sites .
Some positives are that it is in a good location for the tube .
 It's a great location   ,  literally a minute's walk to Gloucester Road tube station, 5 mins walk to the Victoria   Albert Museum and the British Science Museum .
 But for the price, and the favourable location, we were content .
pleasant hotel very good location .
Great location for all London has too offer .
 The hotel is in a very good location for touring London .
Clean rooms, great location, close to the Gloucester Tube entrance .
 The one standout is location , ,  it's only about a block from the Gloucester Rd tube station, which is on the Picadilly line that connects to Heathrow, so being on the west side of London, it's a shorter ride to and from aiport and a very short walk to your hotel with no changes, and then you are close to public transport for the rest of your stay .
Good hotel for the price nice location .
 No noise problems   and a nice, convenient location .
Perfect Location and Excellent Hotel .
Room ,  clean, good size, everything you need is in the room including the coolerLocation ,  within every attractions, short walk or you can take the double decker just across the street .
Great location ,  good value place to stay .
The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum benefits from a fantastic location, right next to Gloucester Road Tube   or to Paddington Station for the Heathrow Express .
 Believe me, the location alone is worth the stay .
The location is fantastic near Gloucester Station which was very handy for all our needs in transport !
The breakfast we had 1 morning was to say the least quite incredible there was so much variety, there was also no complaint in this area with the staff they were right on the ball   helpfulThis hotel while being high rise had some low moments for us as we felt some areas were really lacking but the hotels location is superb and staff like Peter did try and make your stay worth while .
The location is South West London and a healthy but doable walk from landmarks like the Museum of Natural History, Albert's Hall, Kensington Gardens, and Harrods .
LOCATIONA block from Gloucester Road Tube which is conveniently on the Piccadilly, District   Circle lines .
 Other reviewers are right, the entrance is in a bizarre location but once you figure it out, it's fine .
Nice clean rooms, good value, and average location near a tube station, but the rooms directing towards the main street outside are all VERY noisy .
Terrific location wonderful staff excellent pub !
 This was our first trip to London and we found the location to be excellent .
 Lovely hotel, terrific location, wonderful helpful staff, immaculately clean rooms .
Great location, 1 min from Gloucester Tube .
Excellent location good value .
Excellent location in the nice and relatively quiet area 100m from Tube station and shops restaurants .
The hotel's location is the best thing about it ,  near the tube stop, museums and Kensington High Street .
For our purposes, the hotel was perfectly adequate ,  the location was good and the room was clean and quiet .
Good location but need upgrade .
I really love the location of this hotel .
 But again, the location could justify charging that price .
The hotel is very nice and the location is excellent .
 If you're looking for a no, frills hotel that is all about location and price, this is your place .
 All, in, all this hotel was a great choice for the price and location .
The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum has a fantastic location for a city break in London .
 The best thing was the location .
Good location ,near the tube  .
Good price   location but no thrills .
 The location is great ,  very close to Gloucester Road Tube, with Waitrose supermarket, coffee shops and restaurants nearby .
Great value and awesome location .
 Instead you get attractively appointed, decent, sized rooms  , AC that works, a modern bathroom, plumbing that doesn't gurgle and bang in the night, iron and board, bathrobe and slippers, lots of TV channels and a location that can hardly be bettered .
 The location is terrific for museum, going and the Royal Albedrt Hall is an easy walk away if you enjoy concerts .
Great Location Nice Rooms Friendly Staff .
Great location service questionable .
 Like other reviews, the location of the hotel is great, seconds around the corner from the tube .
 Location wise, the tube station   is just around the bend and key restaurants Bugis St .
 Great location, close to the Underground and several excellent Pubs .
 Everything was clean, the staff were very friendly and helpful and the location was excellent, all at a relatively cheap cost .
 Location can't be beat, right on bus lines, next to tube station .
A nice hotel  a resonable rate and a great location .
 Location of hotel is great, next to Gloucester Road tube, close to museums, short hike to Buckingham Palace etc .
Location is the only thing it has going for it .
 Great location, okay value and what you would expect .
On the positive side the location of Holiday Inn Forum was very handy for a conference I was attending .
 The location is superb with the tube and bus stops literally steps away .
Nice location by Glouchester tube stop .
The best part about the hotel is the great location in Kensington .
Great Location and great business hotel .
 Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is a perfect no fuss business hotel with fantastic location .
Great location pub in the ground floor .
 Having never been to London, I found it easy to get around to places of interest from this location   .
great location great breakfast !
 Great location ,  we did what others have descibed and turned along Cromwell road and went to the other Holiday Inn in error when we first arrived .
This was my second stay at this location in the past one year .
 The hotel is in an excellent location only a short walk to Gloucester Rd .
The location of the hotel is excellent, in a very nice area right next to the Gloucester Road tube station and direct on the picadilly line from Kings cross .
We thought this was a great value for such a great location .
Great location for vacationer .
The hotel was good and in a great location .
 You cannot beat the location !
 Coming from Cardiff, the location was perfect, as it was straight off the M4 and a short drive on the A4 before reaching the hotel .
it's just a great location, period .
 This hotel provided that and a great location to boot !
the hotel is in a good location .
Convenient Location for Tourists .
 Great location close to Gloucester Road tube stop .
 Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in London .
 Convenient to Gloucester Road tube station, , location could not have been better .
 Great location with cafes, restaurants and grocery stores all around .
All in all a clean room, great location near hyde park and all the stuff in kensington chelea, near tube station , quiet area .
Great location clean and quiet .
 Location is excellent to the tube stations .
The good thing about this hotel is its location, you are a 10 minute walk from Harrods and <U+00A3>13 taxi ride to Covent Garden which will take you past all the tourist attractions :
 Loved the location as it's only a 1, minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube station .
 I like this hotel due to its location, but the management need to get a grip .
 Its in an easy location from the tube, just two minutes walk .
 The hotel has an unbeatable location in a very nice part of South Kensington ,  only 1 block from the Gloucester Road station   .
 The location of the hotel is fine and actually the hotel is not extremely bad but it is extremely EXPENSIVE .
We've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .
The hotel itself is truly in a great location ,  on the same road as the major London museums it took a leisurely 5, 10 minutes to stroll to the wonderful Natural History Museum   a further 5, 10 minutes up the road to Harrods .
 If we hadn't experienced a problem with the a c I would have rated my overall stay here 5 5 for value, location, comfort, etc .
 Location itself is great, but everything else is terrible .
 don t stay here unless if the Kensington location is important to you .
Geat location, clean, relatively quiet inside the rooms, somewhat confortable .
 The main reasons are location and the quality of the air conditioning .
 Yes, the standard rooms are small for two people   and, yes, they seem to have a lot of trainee staff at the front desk, who struggle sometimes with the language, and yes some of the rooms are affected by traffic noise, but for a good location and a no, frills room provider, it is hard to beat .
   Clean rooms, bustling lobby, GREAT location .
 I will NOT recommend this location .
 I travelled during the off, season in January to London, this was my first stay at this location and I would definitely consider doing so again .
 Less than a five minute walk from the tube station and within walking distance to the Museum of Natural History, really a good location .
, ,  The one thing this hotel has it going for it is the location .
With a kid and a stroller, this definitely is a very convenient location .
 Cromwell is a pretty posh and popular location .
A fine hotel and great location .
 We could not have been happier with the location or the room for the price .
Great location indifferent service .
 This being our first ever visit to UK, must say the location of the hotel, just 2min walk from Glousceter Rd tube stn was a great advantage as even during the weekend, Piccadely line remained open, though distict and central lines had some restrictions on a c of maintainence etc .
Good value and excellent location .
 Booking through Priceline led me to the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum which was inexpensive, in a great location, and clean and comfortable .
 The location of the hotel is great because it's about a block from the Gloucester Road Tube Station which is on several Tube lines .
 In short, the location of the hotel made travel around London and getting to train stations to go out of London incredibly easy .
 Overall, we felt this hotel was in a convenient location and a good deal for a London hotel .
 As other reviewers mentioned, good location and lots around to do eat see enjoy .
Nice hotel with great location .
 The location is excellent, just a half a block from the Glouster Rd .
 Also, the tour bus most likely will not drop you off at your hotel after the tour, but rather at Victoria Station or some location nearest your hotel as the bus driver can get .
 Also, the close location of the gloucester road tube stop is great for getting around all of london .
 Great location ,  a couple of minutes walk from Gloucester Rd underground station, and shops, restaurants, internet cafe etc
Great location but don't bring the car !
 The location is great however, only 5 mins walk from the Gloucester Road tube and 10 mins walk to the South Kensington museums, Albert Hall, etc .
 The hotel is in an ok location ,  close the the Gloucester Rd tube station .
The location of the hotel was great .
 Otherwise, really great location with the refrige being key .
This is our 2nd time at the Kensington Forum and love the location .
Location was great come out of tube station, take first turn right and walk 150 yards   you're there !
 Location was great ,  close to tube stop .
The location of the hotel was excellent, a 5 min stroll from Gloucester Road tube, next to tesco express and a large supermarket just around the corner .
 The location is perfect, very central and very near the subway .
 However the location was great with the underground and good restaurants   nearby .
One of the nicest features about this hotel is the location .
So many employees, a wonderful location, an impressive building .
Well, after all, as I said, great location, great view, NOTHING ELSE !
 On a positive note the location is great and the overworked staff did their best however if visiting London their are definitely better options such as the NH which is just around the corner .
 Perfect location, right around the corner from the tube .
 Our parents who are 55, 70 were able to wonder around the entire city by themselves due to the ideal location of this hotel .
 Nothing fancy but we were quite happy with the location of the hotel, just like most who have stayed at the hotel before .
 Overall, we found the hotel only good for location and decent room if somewhat cold just like the weather was in London then .
 The breakfasts were excellent and the location is great for viewing London by bus, on foot and by tube  , which is just at the end of the road .
Great Location, Very Clean Miami FL .
 The location in the Kensington area could not have been better, the area is safe, nice and fairly quiet .
A Great Location, Friendly And Polite Staff, First Class Breakfast And Rooms As Described Above Will Have Me Returning Again And Again .
 Very convenient location for Gloucester Road tube .
The location was excellent with a number of good eating options locally and Garfunkels and Ask Pizza located in a complex within a very short walking distance for kids   who want something easy .
 brilliant, behind tube station, near local stores, restaurant, posh area, near kensington park, great central location yet quiet enough in a cul, de, sac location .
 flaw location of main entrance, big signs and big flags on main street but enter from the back, tiny miserable unwelcoming cheap entrance design, confusing to first time visitors .
the only reason to choose this hotel is its location, for other aspects, not up to standard for its price .
 The Forum Holiday is a big high rise and right across the street, is another Holiday Inn, albeit it much smaller which tends to confuse people looking for that 2nd location hotel .
Great Location and Hotel for the Money .
 The location in South Kensington is excellent as the Gloucester Road tube station is just around the corner and is served by 3 main lines, , District, Circle and Piccadilly .
 Can't say enough about the price, quality, location and convenience of this hotel and area .
 Good points excellent location really very close to the tube and the tube is on good lines so not lots of changing .
 The location is in a good location near the tube and only a few minutes by cab to central London   .
 Although in some ways I would have preferred a smaller, more authentic English hotel, we really couldn't beat the combination of price and location   .
Location is good if you plan on taking the tube .
Would recommend the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for location, price  , and cleanliness .
Decent rooms and good location .
Stayed at this hotel, for one night, as the location was ideal for our night out at the Royal Albert Hall   .
As also said before, location is excellent, very near the tube stations, plenty of delis and eating places nearby and a supermarkets for any snacks we wanted for the room .
 Location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now .
good location great deal on priceline .
This hotel is in a very convenient location, just a block and a half from the Gloucester Road tube station .
 Comfortable room with large bed but limited space as is often the case with London hotels, but I found the location excellent .
Stayed between Xmas and New Years and the room, location, etc were what to expect for the price I paid .
 The location was great too as it was next to the tube .
Excellent location but rooms far too hot .
 hotel but would stay again if the price was right due to the excellent location .
Good value in a good location .
 The location was ideal for getting around London .
Which leads us to ,  location, this hotel's best feature .
Stay here ,  you won't regret it,  great price ,  great location .
The Hotel location was absolutely perfect for sightseeing and shopping .
 Overall, for the money, location, and for the piece of mind knowing that its going to be clean and comfortable, look no further .
Perfectly adequate  excellent location .
 THe location was great, just aroung the corner from the tube .
 But we also didn't give them any hard times, so they didn't have to fake anything  ,   The location of the hotel is just perfect .
 As everyone mentions, the location was perfect for sightseeing .
,  very clean,  quiet,  bathrooms appear to have been updated recentlyThe hotel location is great .
 The location is fab ,  near the Gloucester underground station and the Waitrose grocery store .
Excellent location shame about the service !
 Fantastic location and local amenities i .
 The location is great and the Tube station is very close .
 good hotel for the price and location .
 Apart from that, the staff were friendly and the location is great .
 The location is incredibly convenient, with lots of restaurants and easily walkable to the tube .
The single thing to recommend this hotel is the location, which is excellent .
The location is EXCELLENT, just round the corner from the subway .
 Friendly helpful staff, clean and comfortable rooms and not to mention its great location .
This hotel is in a very good location ,  tube, buses, restaurants, shopping and museums all within very easy walking distance .
 All in all, if you do not mind giving up the Euopean atmosphere, the Holiday Inn gives you a comfortable stay with the most convenient location .
Location was great being only a few yards from the Gloucester Road tube on Piccadilly, Circle and District lines and was therefore an ideal base for our sight seeing visit .
 Great location and can't beat the price and the comfort !
 Since this location is the designated layover site for American Airlines, there were tons of pilots and flight attendants everywhere, but that added to the  familiar  feeling of having Americans around .
 Pleasant staff, clean hotel, comfortable beds, with a great location .
Good Price Great Location Would definately stay there again !
 Anyway it may not have the charm or history of other hotels in London, but for the price location we would   visit again .
Excellent location clean but small .
The best feature of this hotel is it's location .
The location is perfect with many everything you need just outside the door including a great French patisserie and coffee shop .
 Best part of all is the location, loved the Gloucester Road tube station nearby and the South Kensington area in general, very safe to walk around in any time day or night .
 Gloucester Road tube station is at the westernmost side of zone 1, making it a perfect location between the airport and central London .
The location of the hotel is superb ,  2 minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube   .
 Location is hard to beat though .
The hotel was clean, the beds were comfortable and the location was great .
 Maybe I'm being a little harsh so if you can get this hotel at a good rate it is probably just about worth it, as it has an excellent location .
Awesome location comfortable rooms .
Great service and perfect location !
 I would definately recommed this hotel to anyone as it is unbeatable for price and location in London .
 I wanted a good location, above all else, and this hotel fills that need .
For a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .
 It's a great location and the rooms are nice and clean and yes, a bit small but definately NOT tiny .
 It's a great location VERY near the Gloucester Rd tube stop   .
 Perfect if you are going to see the sights in London, , great location to get around from, , right downtown .
A decent hotel with a great location .
 The raves about the location are well deserved .
 it's a solid property, with an amazing location !
Again the location just can't be beat !
Great Location ,  Just fine for our stay .
Very convenient location one block from Gloucester Road tube station .
 It is in a very good location for catching the tube or the Hop On Hop Off bus tour .
  The hotel caters to airline personnel, cruise tourists, and is a good choice for someone that wants to have a safe location .
Good location if you want to be near the Piccadilly line to Heathrow  , but otherwise very average .
Solid Deal in a Great Location .
Excellent Hotel Excellent Location !
Location wise it is a 5 min walk to the tube and you are on the circle, district and picadilly line .
 The location is great though to get to the Tube and sites around West london and i got a good rate for the room .
The top feature of The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is its location, in a superb area of London that's clean, safe and interesting .
Not impressed at all and will not stay again despite good location .
 But it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again .
We thought this modern, efficient hotel was excellent value for such a great location in the heart of London .
Great location  great breakfast  bathrooms tiny .
 The location of the hotel is, as stated earlier, absolutely fine and well within walking distance of the V A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum and Hyde Park .
 The location can't be beat , ,  a two, minute walk from the Gloucester Road tube stop .
 Great location, close to a tube station with a 24 hour Tesco metro nearby   .
 Mother was very pleased with the location and convenience .
 GREAT location and bargain internet price !
 The rooms are a standard European size   but they are kept spotlessly clean and the hotel couldn't be in a better location .
The location of the hotel was brilliant ,  really nice area .
 Still, if you're just looking for a cheap place to lay your head, the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is a great location .
 The location is fantastic, , you're literally around the corner from the Tube station  there's a Sainsbury's supermarket right above the aforesaid Tube station   .
Another plus is its location ,  convenient to the tube, museums, shops, etc .
This was our second stay stay at this hotel based on it's location .
b basis Hotel huge ,  900 rooms Buffet breakfast good for a buffet This is a well run hotel with a great location for the metro  Rooms a bit on the small side but I would stay again
 The location is also good because it is literally 150 footsteps   from Gloucester Road Underground Station .
I have stayed in a few hotels in London while touring but it would be difficult to find a better location in London for the tourist class who is looking for value, efficiency and cleanliness .
 The location and American standards   are nice touches .
 The location was perfect, just a minute from the Gloucester Rd .
 We were easily able to navigate the city from this location .
 The hotel is clean, modern, and in an excellent location .
 But we would definitely stay again because of the hotel's location .
 Aside from that, the location is great and the furnishings were modern and very comfortable .
Excellent location and service .
 The location is excellent, just a short walk from the Gloucester Road tube station and in a lovely neighborhood .
 Overall an above average hotel based on location and price   but not one for a romantic get, away !
Location is fantastic ,  both on bus line and underground, with many useful stores on Gloucester Rd .
This is a good basic hotel which has a terrific location .
,  checked us in at 11 am after a transatlantic flight,  room larger than average, compared to our continental Europe travel,  location, location, location  .
 The location is right next to the Picadilly line tube stop, so it is very convenient to get around town and also to the airport .
Great location, grocery store open 24 hours within 5 mins walk and friendly international staff, will stay here again .
Great location ,  but executive room not worth it !
We enjoyed our trip to London ,  and the location for the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum was terrific .
I do recommend the hotel ,  it was clean, excellent location, there was ice on the top floor along with one microwave, etc .
 Right off of the Piccadilly and Circle tube lines, the location is excellent .
 It is a relatively new hotel, clean and has a great location which is close to the underground with 3 connecting lines, it gives you an advantage to go anywhere without changing lots of trains .
 Fantastic location right next to Gloucester Rd tube station .
Excellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .
 All in all great location ,  nice restaurants nearby, nicely pitched service .
 Speaking of the tube, the location really is great 1 block away !

The location of the hotel is excellent ,  one block from the tube Gloucester Rd and the surrounding neighborhood is fantastic ,  take a walk from High Street Kensington to the hotel ,  I'd love to live there !
Great Hotel Great Location Great Value !
 The biggest advantage of this hotel is it's excellent location just off of Gloucester Road in Kensington, with the Undergroud one block away, along with several nice restaurants and pubs in the area .
 Although the location is a bit removed from the West End, it is only a block away from the Gloucester Road underground, with three train lines that will take you almost anywhere in the city in 15 minutes or less .
great location good but large tourist hotel .
 The location is great and very convenient .
The location is great but there are many hotels in the same area so I might try out others but would certainly consider coming back .
Can't beat the location, rooms, value and view !
Good Value Nice Hotel Fantastic Location .
Holiday Inn KF has a location that cannot be beat .
 this is definitely the location you want .
Great location loved the hotel .
 The tube station is right there and the location is great for getting around London .
 You could not beat the location or the price .
 The price is moderate for the service and the location .
I will say this hotel is in a wonderful location, right across from the gloucester tube station and only a stop or two away from Notting hill, Harrods, and Kensington High street .
Location is so convienent to the tube and grocery .
 Other than room size, we were very happy with the hotel, especially its location .
 Overall good hotel and very good location close to the tube   .
 The hotel has a great location with easy access to most of London's tourist sites .
 The room is a tad small but is super clean and great location .
 The price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted .
Yes I do stay here a lot and as such, guess that I get extra special treatment but it is in a great location with the tube within a 2 min walk surrounded by places to eat and drink and far enough out of central London to be quiet but you can still be in the west end in 15 minutes .
GREAT LOCATION COMFORTABLE HOTEL .
Outstanding location, even an internet cafe nearby .
 the hotel is in a GREAT location .
 Great location, freshly renovated, very small rooms, anonymous hotel, acceptable service .
 The location couldn't be better in my opinion .
Price and location can't be beat .
 As said by others, an absolutely excellent location, on tube lines that will get you to just about anywhere .
 The location could not have been better with being so close to the Underground station and near good restaurants, grocery stores, post office, pharmacy, Internet cafe .
 The hotel is set in an absolutely ideal location, offers great rates, and excellent conceirge   .
 Great location, one block from the Gloucester Tube station with a number of acceptable restaurants in the area within walking distance .
Best location and unbeatable price !
This is an awesome location right near the Gloucester Road tube stop .
 Definitely stay here if you are on a budget ,  and even if not, it's still nice and the location is really the best !
 A true bargain in the London hotel market, and a very convenient location adjacent to the Gloucester road underground station .
Excellent location but a couple of problems .
 The location is excellent being a few minutes walk from Gloucester Road tube station with its good connection to Heathrow airport and to central London .
Great choice in a great location .
 The location could not be better ,  one block from the intersection of Cromwell and Gloucester Roads, with the Glouster Road tube stop .
 I say  fortunate  because the location was perfect for my needs as a first, timer .
 This is definitely a modern hotel, no English charm here, but the location and the price can't be beat .
 The location could not be better and best of all it was so clean .
 Everything worked well, was in good condition and the room was quiet in spite of the hotel's busy location .
 Service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient   .
Great room fabulous price wonderful location !

" In fact, the entire navigation structure has been completely revised ,  I'm still getting used to it but it's a huge step forward .
Navigation is a huge improvement .
 Clearly, Amazon was hard at work to make navigation quicker and easier .
 I tried out the free 14 day trial on newspaper downloads, what a great way to get your news,  no advertising distractions, easy to navigate and automatically downloaded every day .
 Once I got used to it, the navigation was easy too .
 The Sony store is cumbersome to navigate, and slow .
Despite the lighter text, I prefer the K2 for its thinness and its improved navigation and I use if far more than my K1 .
 On the Kindle, you have wireless delivery, easy navigation, no ads, no need to flip to page D17 and find the place where you left off .
The main issue I had with Kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .
 It is easy to navigate without any risk of accidentally changing the page I'm on .
 The home page is easier to navigate .
 It lets you quickly navigate periodicals ,  moving to the next article with just a click right or left, or up to the section or article list with a flick up or down .
 Losing the side cursor gives Kindle 2 a cleaner look ,  but it's the greatly improved navigation that's the real benefit .
 This ease of navigation is one of the most compelling new features of Kindle 2 for me .
 The problem with Kindle and I expect E, readers is that while Amazon is asking the book publishers to adhere to a standard of navigation to support these features, Amazon does not have the manpower to review each book submitted to see if its been published to their specification .
 Amazon claim's it's only 20% faster, but it FEELS almost twice as fast ,  and the menus are much better organized and easier to navigate .
 The pictures were crisp and clear, and it was a quick learning curve to navigate between pages, articles, and sections .
 The controls are well placed, and the procedures for navigation are easy to learn .
 Easy to read, navigate, etc .
The 5 way navigator is easily worth mentioning .
 It makes navigating much easier .
 The navigation stick works much better than I expected .
0 out of 5 stars Significant improvements to ergonomics and navigation, February 24, 2009
There are several on, screen navigation improvements due to faster e, ink :
The Kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .
There is a new 5, way navigation toggle for left, right, up, down plus  press  .
I'm generally enjoying these navigation changes .
 It is significantly easier to hold and to navigate relative to the Kindle 1 .
 This is a beautiful little product  it feels sleek and sturdy and   booklike in my hands, the controls are finally where they ought to be and the navigation interface is intuitive and easy to learn .
 As advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .
Some PDFs' tables of contents DID work as a navigable set of links .
For typing and navigating, the e, ink technology takes patience and a little getting used to , ,  especially for frenetic folks in task mode .
 1 the ink takes a moment to display on the screen after your input from the keyboard or navigation contoller  2 the keyboard input is stiff and requires a direct punch on the very tiny keys to register  3 the keyboard is so close to the bottom of the unit, and the Kindle is so flexible, typing is something of a laborious or even tortured action for relatively short notes such as this paragraph actually written on the Kindle 2 .
Navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .
 There can be occassional minor  ghosting  problems where the screen does not completely update on a page turn or when navigating .
 I realize the K1 did not have this either, but it sure would be easier to touch the places you want to navigate than use the joystick .
 Instead, it displays the book title and there is no way to navigate to the last page read .
 The fastest way to navigate through a larger work   would be to leave your page, go to the table of contents and choose the most likely chapter and then proceed page by page from there till you reach your desired page .
 As mentioned above, the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what I did .
 Again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .
I think in most areas the Kindle 2 has met expectations, but a sluggish cursor, poor navigation and almost non, existent capability to organize content are major drawbacks .
 The largest difference was the touch screen at the bottom, but once you're doing the primary thing that e, readers do   it becomes a non, issue, as it's only for navigation .
 It's actually slightly more awkward to navigate using the touch screen because you have to look between both screens, whereas with the Kindle you just use the directional rocker in the planned direction .
The Kindle is really fun to use and I'm having a blast learning to navigate it and how to use all its features .
 I find navigating the device page turns, menus, etc .
I also found using the navigation button difficult .
 I have some more to learn about searching and navigating, but if an old geezer like me can do it, anybody can .
>> Far better navigation between articles in periodicals, and easier navigation overall with its five, way controller replacing the K1's clumsy and time, consuming navigation wheel and cursor
 The new navigation button works well, and the keyboard   feels good to my fingers .
The thumb stick navigation on the Kindle takes some getting used to, especially those who use touch screens or mice everyday .
3 Easy page turns and navigation .
 Navigating the menu is almost intuitive and becomes easier and easier as you go .
 The buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively .
 I find it easier to have it in hand than navigating through the on, screen version .
 The pages are easy to flip, the menu is easy to navigate, and it is easy to forget that you are not reading a  real  book !
 The screen reads like paper, it is easy to navigate .
 I find myself reading faster, because the text is more readable for me, and the navigation through the book is so very easy .
 I couldn't imagine trying to navigate internet pages without it .
 I really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .
I found the screen readability and overall user experience of navigating the device to be excellent .
I found the Kindle Store to be full featured and easy to navigate, and was impressed that you even have the ability to write book reviews directly from the device .
 The buttons on the K2 are not easily pressed while reading, and I love the 5, way button that allows me to easily navigate between my newpaper pages   .
I was worried about navigation without the scroll wheel, but find it much easier to use and it is more productive and faster to use the new navigation .
","navigation_amazon_kindle","Navigation is quick and easy.
The pages are easy to flip, the menu is easy to navigate.","New navigation system is fast and efficient.
Navigation ease improved the product greatly.
Better than previous model.","Its very easy and fast to navigate.","You navigate the new Kindle using a 5 way controller.
Much improved over the previous version of the Kindle.",NA
" Parking was expensive but I think this is common for San Fran .
 there is a fee for parking but well worth it seeing no where to park if you do have a car .
 The parking was free, which was great, and the hotel was conveniently located for public transport, and local attractions .
As for in, and, out parking, I have seen a lot of San Francisco with no car at all .
 They have a parking garage, but they make you leave your vehicle for them to park   and then if you want to take a drive later, you have to wait for the staff to get it .
 There is no real parking space, so I had to pull up in front of the hotel in a small space .
There was valet parking at a cost of $42 .
 Rooms are very comfortable and we were charged $15 for parking our motorcycle in the garage .
 Our ONLY complaint was one doorman valet wasn't thrilled about us parking the car at the front 
 Parking is easier then you might realize .
 There is a parking ramp across the street that is MUCH cheaper then hotel parking .
 Our room rate was all in order <U+0096> we<U+0092>d booked a TravelZoo special, and the front desk had the right rate, and the right parking discount .
 Of course you have the added thrill of paying over $40 a night for parking and whatever your chiropractor bill is when you are done with the beds .
I found a great mid week deal that included a discount on parking .
On the other hand, the valet parking attendant bell people were very friendly .
Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .
 However, parking is $30 night and valet only, which becomes a pain .
Only other downer was $38 per night for valet parking .
room was quiet, clean with good beds but very very smallnot a cheap hotelvalit parking was to much expencive but oke its the location
 Parking is crazy expensive, we drove up from LA so we had a car ,  but otherwise, you really don't need it .
 Parking is expensive   and everything is very much within walking distance .
 Valet parking is, in my view, unreasonably high at $38 per night, but again we knew this before we arrived so can't really complain .
 As most hotels in the city, parking is expensive so unless you really need a vehicle it<U+0092>s cheaper to just buy a MUNI Passport during your stay .
 The hotel does have parking, but it is expensive and hard to get around the city while driving .
 The parking was steep  , so if I had to do it again I would have parked 1 2 block north for about half of that .
 Parking at $45 a night was outrageous, but probably worth it to keep your car safe .
 We did not have a car, hotel parking is expensive .
 The valet parking was very convenient and seemed secure as it is attached to the hotel .
 A lot of hotel parking garages lots are not on the same premises as the hotel in the area .
 First, the biggest &quot gotcha&quot  is the mandatory valet parking .
 Not trying to bad mouth the Tuscan, it is a nice place to stay, and if you're not put off by the valet parking, you shouldn't be too disappointed .
 Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .
 The prize for vallet parking is steep but I think you can expect that anywhere you go in San Francisco .
 Valet parking was $45 per night with tax, but that includes in and out privileges and my car was there whenever I needed it .
 Watch out for steep parking rates of about $45 per night .
 This total includes the taxes and tips for mandatory valet parking .
Aside from the parking rate, you won't be disappointed .
 The other thing that I found disappointing was I can't remember the exact details but something like the charge they quote for parking   was even more than that because there was some sort of a tax .
 Onsite parking is available .
 I called before we ever arrived to inquire about it and was told that parking was no problem at all .
 I guess calling to inquire about parking while giving them our name and reservation dates didn't warrant the clerk to inform us that we should make a reservation for our car also .
 Valet parking is provided at $36 day which was, I thought, excessive .
Walgreens has same souvenirs the airport shops do for 1 2 $Do not rent a car, waste of time, money,   no parking !
The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .
 At the hotel, it is valet only parking .
 Check for Internet deals and don't pay for their parking .
 I do think that if you are staying at a hotel you should not have to pay for parking .
The hotel, located a few blocks from Fisherman's Wharf as well as Ghiardelli Square, has a nice Italian theme that carries into the lobby as well as the uniforms for the parking valets .
 Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .
 Not only is it pricey at $36 day, but having nothing but valet parking means you have no access to your car unless you have one of the valets fetch it from the lot for you .
 Although our room was indeed non, smoking   and we had a king size bed we ended up on the 3rd floor and our room, facing Mason Street, overlooked a concrete multi, story parking lot although if you stood at the window you could see the Coit Tower which was a nicer view !
 Several have mentioned the charge for parking .
 It really does save if you can get a deal with free parking, but the fee is not out of line .
 Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .
 Another irritant was the crazy parking fees for the hotel .
 They do a good job and are a heck of a lot cheaper than a cab and you won<U+0092>t have to mess with the parking fees .
 When I got a GREAT deal $99 INCLUDING parking !
The great thing for us was the free parking .
 Normally parking is $36 a night so getting that thrown in was a fantastic steal .
We stayed at the BW Tuscan Inn only because they were offering a great winter deal , $99 for a room with king, size bed and free parking   .
 Overall, we would recommend this place to friends, especially if they are able to get a good discount and free parking .
 Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel .
 staff were helpful although the valet parking and the laundry costs were extremely expensive .
 They allowed this, so we only had to pay the regular parking fee of the hotel .
 Way too much money to pay for parking, but that is the way it is in San Francisco .
 You don't need a car because parking is a nightmare .
all these hotels charge parking fees .
 Parking at the hotel is expensive at $32 plus tax per night but the up side is that you have in out privilages .
Parking in the city is a royal pain !
 Although the parking charge is steep, it seems to be the market price in San Francisco, or as the locals like to call it :
 I notice on other reviews the high cost of parking which we didn't have to consider as we were advised you do not need a car to get around SF, and this is quite true .
 All in all, the location was perfect ,  a short walk to the cable cars or bus lines, a Safeway grocery and Walgreens drugs is across the street in a parking garage, type mall, and there are small places to eat breakfast nearby plus an IHOP a few blocks over .
 Parking at the hotel was a hefty $32 per day with unlimited in and out privileges .
 Parking is an issue in SF so either pay the $30 .
 In addition, the valet parking is apparently handled by an outside contractor, and turned out to be considerably more expensive than we had been told ,  $35 day ,  which seemed very high .
 Because of the exhorbitant $29 valet parking fee, we only rented a car for Sonoma and Napa for one day .
 You'll be having fun while some other poor sod is looking for a parking space that isn't there .
30 am, we discovered that the parking garage next door   would not be open until 7 ,  7 :
 I thought the $29 per day parking was ridiculous, but I hear that's the standard in SF .
Upon arriving, there was a very long and confusing to do with the valet parking ,  we hadn't gotten our luggage out of th car and the valet wanted the keys .
 There was a fee of $29 per day for the parking .
 Valet parking attendant was no better .
 paid $161 plus tax along with a $20 parking fee .
As far as parking is concerned, we were shell, shocked at what most of the hotels charge for parking<U+0097>up to $40 night .
 The Tuscan is $29 night, but if you search for a package rate on their web site, you may get parking included in your room rate .
 And, conveniently, there is a Safeway and a drug store hidden in the parking garage across the street .
 We didnt have or need a car so we didnt have to deal with parking a car I believe it is $30 a day, ,  par for the city .
 It is located 2 blocks from the wharf which was outstanding considering parking is hard to come by .
Note to those with a car, overnight valet parking is $26 but right next door the car park is $15 and it takes about 30 seconds to get from your car back to the hotel ,  why pay $26 ?
 Parking was $26 day ,  free valet with on and off priv .
 Make sure you realize that you pay for parking .
00 for valet parking, but that was okay .
 I was aupset, since my $89 night room had gone to $138 night between the parking   and the pet charge .
 We didn't pull our car out of the parking garage the whole time we were there .

 I purchased a 2004 V6,  Leather and I did not think Honda could do any better with design or performance .
 I love the styling the performance and handling .
I was looking for a luxury, feel car with great performance at a good price .
Overweight ,  3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the VCM and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver .
 The interior design and the performance of the V6 are the highlights .
I was looking for a mid size coupe with style, performance and all season traction capability .
Styling in and out is fantastic, and the v, 6 performance is all one would hope for and more .
 It does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying .
After tracking almost 2 months of research on American and Japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  Honda Accord and Toyota Camry .

One word of advice is to be really careful about which anti, malware software you install since it will degrade performance both on and off the internet on these netbooks .
 Whatever you elect to install I would highly recommend you benchmark the performance both before and after .
 I expect to get 6, 7 hours in high performance mode .

 Asus' center of excellance is in very reliable, very stable, high performance circuitry, mainly motherboards .
 I have the Super Hybrid Engine set to auto mode, which I'm guessing is less than High or Super Performance   .

 Overall though, I am happy with the performance .
4 PASS ,  Battery life is amazing, used the laptop in  Super Performance Mode  for over 6 hours of watching videos, checking email, connecting with USB Verizon broadband card, and still had battery life leftover .
As for the performance of this little computer, I've gotta tell ya :
 The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .
 Just some advice ,  use Eset's anti, virus and not Norton, McAfee, CA or the like ,  if not you will loose a lot in performance .
 Upgrade to 2gb of memory, but did not seem to make much different in performance in either xp or windows 7 .

 I keep a couple of apps running and its performance is great .
Amazon seems to be concerned that I am simply  experiencing performance or compatibility problems , , and that my computer thus does not qualify as  defective  by their criteria, , but I would contend that a new computer that cannot be supplied with electricity is a complete lemon .
 The reviews on many of the higher resolutions netbooks also stated poor video and processing performance .
 I haven't hit my swap yet in several weeks of heavy use, and performance has been more than satisfactory for what I do with it .
 Replacing them isn't very hard given a screw and five minutes, and doing so noticeably ups the performance .

The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .
 The only area that I've seen, so far, where the performance is not adequate, is with some streaming videos, but that's not important to me .

I'm actually downgrading in performance in getting this netbook but the performance lost is made up with the smaller form factor and greatly increased battery life .

" If a case was included, as with the Kindle 1, that would have been reflected in a higher price .
 lower overall price, with nice leather cover .
If you have the first Kindle and are deciding whether to upgrade, do it now while you can still get a good price for your old Kindle on Amazon's Marketplace, craigslist, wherever .
 Before purchasing, I was obsessed with the reviews and predictions I found online and reading about some of the critiques such as the thick border, the lack of touchscreen, lack of battery SD slot, lack of a back light, awkward difficult keyboard layout, minimally faster page flipping, and the super, high price .
 However, I think all the positives of the K2 greatly make it worth the price which I'll talk about below .
 We have all paid for our covers whether it's an  extra  cost or added in to the price of the e, reader .
 Amazon is not charging full price to replace a broken or damaged Kindle .
 I believe that what he said was that when the books were on the NYT Best Seller's list, they would be priced at $9 .
 When the book was no longer on that list, the price could change .
 There are text books and other books that run in the hundreds of dollars price range .
of course they won't be priced at $9 .
 The difference between the books I've purchased and the price of the Kindle is about $166 .
 In addition, the prices for books are often more expensive , ,  particularly new releases .
One last thing I was unaware of is how much free or nominally, priced content there is for the Kindle .
 Konrath are offering novels at prices ranging from $1 to $2 dollars, as a way to find new readers .
00, so the price of Kindle effectively dropped to $349 .
 Savings trump purchase price with Kindle's low book price advantages .
I would have been glad to have paid any price to have had a book reader that was easier to read for myself with 20 20 vision and especially for the low, vision reader .
I did see a few big price differences eg .
The other drawback for some is the price .
 Book prices are less than you will find in book stores and may be less than you will find on other e, book sites .
Is the K2 so much better than the K1 as to justify the price ?
 the BUT comes in and applies to the fact that the price for the downloads has been going up and up .
 since the cost of the kindle is high anyway, the benefit, other than easy storage, was the reduced price of book downloads .
The lack of such an obvious and necessary feature, especially considering the price of the device, really degrades its value and usability .
 I want you to know that ultimately, however, if I want a Kindle I will have to capitulate and accept Amazon's terms because Amazon has a monopoly over their own machine, and I will have to purchase one even at prices I believe are needlessly high for e, book readers .
 And I know for sure that many print publishers will see this as an opportunity to provide attractively priced paper books as an alternative .
 At the steep price of this device we should get better quality components .
 To have this continuous, high speed, wireless connectivity without the need for a physical computer to upload download onto is truly amazing and makes the price of the Kindle truly irrelevant .
 price  , and intuitive operation your parents and grandparents can operate this device, if you are fortunate enough to still have them !
As a teacher, I really wanted this machine and have been waiting for the price to drop so that I could give myself the excuse to purchase it .
 Disappointing given the prices .
 The price for new hardbacks on the Kindle is great too .
 After reading the reviews and pondering the price all day, I took the plunge .
 The ability to plug in headphones and play Miles Davis to drown out the screaming kid while you are reading at the doctors office is priceless .
If you are searching for a REAL review on the Kindle 2 by someone that was waiting to receive it rather than complaining about price or other issues then here it is .
 However, I will say, the selection of inexpensive books has been worth the purchase price of this item  especially for those that enjoy reading the classics or nationwide news, it has been a joy to purchase entire collections for a fraction of the cost of purchasing new or even used books .
 Those in college, with children or just have a love of reading will likely find the convenience and savings well worth the price .
 I found many simply by doing a search on genre's of interest with price  low to high  as a default .
 To justify the purchase price, those functions really need to be there .
 The price of these 'classic' titles is pretty hard to beat, too .
I was a little miffed when i saw that they would now be charging for the Kindle cover, which was included in the price for the previous version .
 Mind you, it's the same size as the Kindle 1, and that of most book pages, but I for one dream of something larger without a larger price tag .
 If I have to spend the full puirchase price on the K2 with a K1 still in hand I would have probably waited .
Although pricey, the real value of this purchase is that it got me to read again .
But, as far as my reading experience with the kindle 2, I have downloaded so many books and all at a fraction of the original price .
 I just hope that the price goes down .
 Yes, it costs extra, but they lowered the price on the Kindle 2 so that buying the basic cover costs plus the purchase price of the device itself equals the cost of a Kindle 1 .
 But given my book storage issues and how much it would cost me to rent a bigger apartment here in the City, I didn't mind paying the current price .
 That may not be true for everyone, but, as I said, I'm sure the price will eventually come down .
 Some people may find this an inconvenience, but I think it is just a small price to pay for delayed convenience especially where I am located .
 Books are retardedly pricey .
 Should have been priced at $250  .
 Even if you want to , I think it is way too pricey .
 The subscription prices and book prices are really good from what my wife tells me .
 Though it would be nice if the cover was included in the K2 price, it is still worth buying .
 It is pricey but if you buy as many books as I do, it will pay for itself within a year due to the low cost of most books .
 The price of the device itself is the only drawback but if your an avid reader like myself the reward far outways the price .
 The price, tag is pretty hefty for most people, though I would counter that the value proposition makes up for it   .
 I'm positive that future releases will bring the price point down .
2, Book Selection & price,  I made a list of 20 books .
 Of the 20, several were priced higher on B&N then amazon, significantly so, while 5 were not available on B&N at all .
 for the price of a few hundred used old, fashioned  paperbacks  and free your shelves for figurines or a nice bottle collection !
When the original Kindle was released, I was intrigued, but never researched it due to the insanely high price tag .
 It was obviously out of my price range .
 One, for what you get it is over priced .
Last I would suggest for the price a protective cover should be included with the product .
The price, tag for this item is quite steep when you first look at it .
 I checked the difference in price between the cheapest print available of the books and the Kindle Editions .
 Turns out some of them were the same price, while others were much cheaper for the Kindle .
 she thought she wanted one, but was a bit daunted by the price and the question of how much she would actually use it .
 I thought about buying an eBook reader for a few months and had thought i would go with the B&N Nook until i compared book prices between B&N and Amazon .
 Amazons book are priced significantly lower and easier to find in my opinion .
 Ultimately, I end up paying full price and have for many years .
 About a month ago after finishing in one weekend and realizing that I paid $28 for it I thought Kindle's cheaper prices and mobility would be great .
 I can download samples and buy books for $10 so I have a lot of things I would not buy if I had to pay full price .
Books are priced in US$ for oversea consumers .
99, thus offsetting the high price of the Kindle .
 Perhaps the misunderstanding was mine, but I find myself once again buying books or borrowing from the Library because of inflated prices for the new releases .
 If Amazon reduces their prices back to the $9 .
99 price and credits those who've paid more, I'll once again recommend Kindle .
 Another has a desire to obtain old books ,  we looked up Moby Dick and she was amazed that the price was only $1 .
Most of the complaints about the Kindle price, b&w, no wifi, etc .
As to price, I usually purchase books on a weekly basis .
 While the price of the Kindle 2 isn't inexpensive, adding up how much I spend in books and how much room they take up !
 I had been wanting a Kindle but had balked at getting one because of the price, but after our last move and packing up all of our books, and giving many away I was more open to the idea .
 I was still hesitant after I saw the Kindle 2 because of price .
 The ability to clip articles, make notes and save items for later is priceless .
 Even the price doesn't bother me .
 In addition, you can sort the Kindle books by price and find many more free books .
 Reading is something that I absolutely love, but I find it hard to wait several days for a book to be shipped to me or pay the outrageous prices at a bookstore .
I would love a case cover that's well made and doesn't cost a third the price of the device .
 I must say that I am shocked at how many of these  reviews  are one stars given by people complaining about the price but dont even own a Kindle !
 There are many other ways such as mp3 players, portable DVD players, not to mention the radio to listen to while driving, that are almost fully paid for by the price for just one audio book .
I don't miss the pricetag of a printed book !
 to buy the international version of the kindle 2, I have to admit, that this is a great device and for me worth the price .
no waiting time for the paperback version, and getting the e, book version almost for the same price as the paperback version

Great Price Terrific Location .
Our main focus before booking was looking for a low price with good location .
 All for the bargain price off <U+00A3> 250 for 2 nights including return rail to North Wales .
Explore the area and you will find plenty of pubs where you can eat for a reasonable price .
 Half expected a noisy room by the elevator for the bargain price we paid, but instead got a 17th floor room with awesome city view .
 The price we paid for our rooms was reasonable .
I got this hotel on price line for a 4 night stay with my boyfriend for our anniversary, for about <U+00A3>80 a night inc taxes, however after reading reviews about this hotel I was very worried about staying here .
 Breakfast is ok, but not worth paying for if it's not included in your room price .
 If you're looking for a clean place to rest your head at a decent price and want flexibility to check in or out as you please, this is a good place for you .
All in all, it was a decent hotel, but I think I may try somewhere else next time purely just to see what else is available at the same kind of price .
 We ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .
 For the price and location, this was a very great hotel .
 Price was unbeatable, just 79 pounds night .
 We got this for $75 a night, which is a lot cheaper than any listed price we could find .
Our breakfasts and one dinner meal were included in our price .
 One day late and I paid the same price for a better room in HI Kensington, the supposedly better classed HI nearby   .
 If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .
\the staff is very friendlyi had found a really nice price and for this money this hotel was incredible .
 For the price and the location I thought this place was great .
 Good pub nearby   with wonderful breakfasts and meals at a good price .
 As previous reviewers have said, there's a variety of shops nearby   and breakfast of a better quality and price can be bought there .
 and fully intend to come back again ,  if the price is right .
I booked this one as none of my favourites were available and I was amazed at the lowish price offered .
Very happy with the hotel for the price .
 Overall for the price I think it was extremely good value .
The biggest disappointment was the price of Internet .
 However, if you are looking for a comprehensive hotel experience, I'm sure there are plenty of better hotels available for the same price in the city .
 But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .
Great Hotel for a great price .
I used priceline' name your own price and my bid of a $100 night was exepted for a Sunday and a Monday night .
Good hotel for the price nice location .
 It's nicer than certain other hotels you'd get in the same price range on Priceline and all in all was nice .
 I wouldn't say it stands out particularly, but if you're looking for a reliable, convenient, comfortable place in London, this is a great place to stay , ,  especially if you can get it at a good price on Priceline or another site like that .
 Nothing that spectacular to justify the price .
It's an okay hotel, and I don't mind staying there again if I get it for a cheap price through Priceline .
Restaurant ,  make sure to try Thai and Singapore restaurants ,  delicious and good price .
 But again, the location could justify charging that price .
 Thought that we would be looked after given its rating and the price paid .
 The price was exceptional for the Kensington area, and as many reviewers have mentioned, it is a two or three minute walk to the Gloucester tube station .
 All, in, all this hotel was a great choice for the price and location .
I booked this hotel via Holiday inn ,2 nights for the price off 1  .
Good price   location but no thrills .
 Got decent price on Hotwire as well .
 Overall, for the price  , it is a pretty good deal .
 Good price through ExpediaHotel in general is in good shapeTips :
 I would not stay at this Holiday Inn again unless the price was halved, because there are simply too many places offering better value in London .
 Breakfast was appalling, plenty of it, you certainly won<U+0092>t starve, but the quality was awful considering the price paid .
 I was shown an executive room if i wanted to upgrade, for the price of 35 pounds a night .
All in all a pleasant stay for a good price .
 Although the menu is limited it was very good and a reasonable price .
 In particular, there was a nice Indian run coffee breakfast restaurant across the street from the tube stop on Gloucester Road that served a good English breakfast at a decent price .
 Would definitely recommend this hotel if only for the fair price I got on priceline combined with the great, convenient location, which made it easy to get to all the touristy sites in London .
 Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .
 Just make sure you eat as much as you can for the price you have paid .
 I would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .
 However, the first price that they charged me was too much so I had to get a refund then be charged the correct amount for a standard room .
 ,  smallish roomsOld style bar pubNo ventilation on a smoking floorIt's not worth the hotel web, site price of <U+00A3>160 for STD room .
In short it's a good hotel if you get the price off lastminute .
com   and not the hotel web, site price of <U+00A3>160 .
We've stayed in London a lot and booked this hotel for one night due to a number of factors ,  the location, the price   the availibility of a room to accomodate three adults .
Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying <U+00A3>17 more per night than I'd expected .
Despite the above problems I would recommend a stay here, price dependant .
Bought the room for about 1 2 price using Hotwire .
 Don't buy the bottled water from the hotel ,  go to the supermarket and get it for half the price !
 However, a continental breakfast was included in the price and had a fairly large selection .
 We could not have been happier with the location or the room for the price .
 The bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room  in a lot of hotels that I looked at online in the same price range, bathrooms were not en suite .
 I would stay here again if the price was right .
the only reason to choose this hotel is its location, for other aspects, not up to standard for its price .
 In sum, we wouldn't pay rack rate for this hotel, but at a reduced price it's an efficient, functional place to stay in London .
 I would not pay rack rate for a room here, but it is quite attractive at a discounted price .
00 which is an affordable price for a hotel in the posh area of Kensington .
 Hotel was clean, convenient to tubes, internet cafes, and local dining of all price ranges and styles .
 Also got a good price for the room thro priceline about 47 pounds per night, hotel very clean and well run .
All in all I would recommend and would stay again if the price was right !
 I had prepaid for the room on Hotwire good price at $120 .
 If you are just looking for basic lodging at a good price in London,  this is the place .
 Although in some ways I would have preferred a smaller, more authentic English hotel, we really couldn't beat the combination of price and location   .
 If you're from the US, think 2, 3X the average price when you convert to US dollars .
Would recommend the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum for location, price  , and cleanliness .
 Location is great, hotel is wonderful, and price is right, it really is hard to beat right now .
Our amazing deal from priceline did not include breakfast, but there were many places in the neighborhood to grab breakfast for a reasonable price before heading out for the day .
Stayed between Xmas and New Years and the room, location, etc were what to expect for the price I paid .
 My friend and I had one pancakes and syrup, two orange juices, one tea, and one smoked salmon and scrambled egg with english muffin for <U+00A3>8   in total ,  the same price as one discounted breakfast at the hotel !
 So often I have booked a hotel at a price only to be disappointed with my choice on arrival .
 hotel but would stay again if the price was right due to the excellent location .
 The bags were located in the closet, but no price list .
 I could have bought a new pair of jeans for that price .
All in all it was just what we expected based on the price and would stay here again .
Stay here ,  you won't regret it,  great price ,  great location .
 The shower pressure was a bit low but that's the price you pay for the top floor and it was well worth it  ,  Instead of minibar there was an empty fridge which came quite handy for our own beverages, I doubt they would have milk in their minibar  ,  Tea and coffee making facilites and iron with board were a great bonus to what we had expected from our room .
  The only downsize of this hotel I see in the cost of breakfast, with price of more than <U+00A3>15 for full English breakfast or <U+00A3>10 if booked in advance .
Our Hotwire price did not include breakfast, but several restaurants were nearby, and the hotel had a reasonable coffee crossaint deal .
 Reserved this hotel through Hotwire and got a price of $90 night .
 That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast .
Good if you don't pay retail price .
Overall, this hotel is okay if you're on a budget or get a good deal through a discount site, but definitely NOT worth paying retail price for .
 good hotel for the price and location .
 Great location and can't beat the price and the comfort !
Good Price Great Location Would definately stay there again !
 Anyway it may not have the charm or history of other hotels in London, but for the price location we would   visit again .
 We didn't eat at the hotel ,  there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price .
 I would definately recommed this hotel to anyone as it is unbeatable for price and location in London .
 It was a bargain price for the hotel and it was great  .
For a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .
 The room was small, the beds were hard, but a great value for the price we paid .
 GREAT location and bargain internet price !
 There is little difference in the price and when we return to London in three weeks I have booked the Millennium in preference to the Forum .
 Although this was about the same price as the local bars etc .
All in all I would definitly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a pleasant stay in London, in a nice area, at a good price !
We have just stayed in the Kensington Forum and have to say that it is the best hotel we have stayed in in London for the price .
Our one night stay was arranged by the cruise line so I can't comment on the price .
 A very good value for the price .
 Overall an above average hotel based on location and price   but not one for a romantic get, away !
Got this at a great price via priceline and at first was worried about Holiday Inn,  as usually don't care too much for this chain in the U .
 Considering the horrible exchange rate GBP USD at the time we were in London, I believe the price was fair .
 I<U+0092>m pretty sure the driver took the most direct route from the hotel, so not sure why the difference in price .
We stayed 5 nights in a room whose price was second lowest .
Excellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .
 Even though this price doesn't include breakfast it was still a great value .
 The Kensington Forum is about as close to an American style hotel as one can reasonably hope to find in London at a reasonable price .
 The continental breakfast which was included in the price was very nice and served in the dining room, a pleasant time before dashing off around the city .
 You could not beat the location or the price .
 The price is moderate for the service and the location .
 The price was a real bargain as the published price at the hotel was 210 pounds  !
 The quality was very good and the price was reasonable .
Excellent hotel excellent price .
 Can't beat the price of $75 per night through Priceline .
 One of the better places I've stayed in London for the price .
 Hard to find better at this price .
00 Pounds, hotel guests get it at the amazing price of 15 .
 For that price you get a glass of champagne, half a lobster and a wonderful hot and cold buffet .
Price and location can't be beat .
 The price for triple cost me 76 pounds at the height of the tourist season .
 The price was right, and we were even told by an English tour guide that we had gotten a very good deal .
 Continental breakfast was included in the price of our room package that we purchased through Northwest Airlines, but the breakfast room on the second floor was a bit of a feeding trough .
Best location and unbeatable price !
 We had terrific price per room and seems hard to beat .
 There is a great supermarket and some restaurants pubs ,  we ate one night at  Ask , which is a small chain of reasonable price .
 This is definitely a modern hotel, no English charm here, but the location and the price can't be beat .
After initial angst of getting a room, after a NY, London flight, I settled for a twin and not a double bedded room, 17th floor , small but very comfortable room, windows do open, bathroom new , staff fine and concierge area knowledgeable and openly interested and helpful, the hotel really tries, dont nit pick small things, dont pay more than $120 max and if you want to at least check out other reliable hotels, there are many shockers at all price ranges, do your research  !
Great room fabulous price wonderful location !

" I previously owned a Toyota 4Runner which had incredible build quality and reliability .
I bought the Camry because of Toyota reliability and quality .
I purchased a 2007 Camry because of the looks of the redesigned model and because of the  legendary  Toyota quality and reliability .
 As of today, I am a bit disappointed in the build quality of the car .
 Disappointed in interior and exterior quality .
 Toyota did a great job with design but forgot about quality !
 This car needs quality improvement !
 The fit and finish in the cabin is not the level of quality I expected .
This car looks great and the build quality is good .
 I am so disappointed in the quality .
I've had 2 Camry's before the one, and bought it thinking that the quality standards known to a Toyota would still remain excellent .
 It's now apparent that Toyota quality took a nose dive .
 Mine suffers from the tranny slip   on the 3, 4 upshift when cold, build quality is good but nothing like the Toyota, hype I was expecting, as it has its share of squeaks and rattles just like a 10 year old Chevy .
 Overall a good car, no build quality issues yet .
After owning a 95 Camry, I expected the same quality .
 The quality of construction, ride, quietness, and legroom are excellent .
 A lot of defects that I still do not understand how my car passed the quality inspection when it was manufactured .
This car offers poor driver's seat comfort, poor vision  , only average ride quality, gas mileage 
 JBL radio is low quality cd, fm, and mp3 all sound the same .
 It has high quality amazing ride and the fit and finish is great .
 However, the quality of this car is not acceptable for Toyota standards .
 Initial quality was lacking and it's only getting worse .
 This is our 6th Toyota and we continue to receive the quality we expect .
s not worth buying given the quality issues .
 Seems the company's quest to be #1 has caused quality issues .
 Interior quality is very poor .
 This was the 7th Camry and the last, I feel Toyota quality is slipping big time .
 This is not the Toyota quality I was expecting .
 Interior exterior quality is very good .
 Overall build quality very good .
 Replaced speakers with Sony speakers, sound quality improved .
 The ride, comfort, and drive is as expected, however, the quality and reputation of yore are completely gone for the flagship Camry .
 It's not a terrible car by any means, but the quality since they starting building them in America has really slipped .
 Horrible quality of interior .
 Some have mentioned disappointing build quality .
As compared to my wife's 2004 Highlander, my new Camry does not exhibit the same build quality .
 While I applaud the new design  , Toyota seems to be slipping in quality .
 Examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .
 The ride, the fit and the build quality are what I was expecting after owning Toyotas in the past .
 This 2007 is the epitome of the Toyota's quality .
 I also am not impressed with the quality .
 The sound quality is excellent and answering or dialing a call couldn't be easier .
 Solid, high quality, comfortable and quiet .
 Depends on gas quality & wind conditions .
 The fit and finish quality is poor .
 Toyota's quality is slipping .
 I paid for quality & all I've gotten thus far is NOT quality  .
 I drive   quality cars and I can attest to the fact this car rides as well as some cars costing considerably more .
 It is a pleasure to drive and it has Toyota quality written all over it .
Great performance, great gas mileage  , superior quality ,  I always thought of a Camry as just a practical family sedan .
 Quality of assembly is outstanding .
 Toyota has this  supposed  impecable quality .
 So far the quality appears to be strong, as expected .
 High quality inside outside finish
 The quality of the leather seats appears to be very good .
My third Camry and by far the worst, the paint is of poor quality .
 Some quality issues with fit and finish .
 I have rattles on both B pillars and the build quality is rather poor, with unsightly gaps in the passenger side dash where it does not fit together properly .
 transmission hunts for gears, ride quality much worse than even a mediocre car, Auto sound level doesn't work, accessory outlets do not work unless car is running or acc is on  , radio shuts off when engine is shut off .
 Excellent interior build quality .
 Was sold by the reputation for quality, reliability, and the 2007 redesign .
 Vehicle ride is extremely smooth, compliant and quiet ,  very close to Lexus quality   for thousands of dollars less .
 The new 2007 Camry should have the higher quality than 1997 Carmry, but not in my case .
I just feel the car is quality throughout .
 The 07 Camry is a high quality car at a very affordable price .
 However, the quality is absolutely terrible for a Toyota .
 I will keep this car, but I hope Toyota improves their quality to their older standards of the mid 90s .
 My transmission works seamlessly and there are no quality issues whatsoever .
 I was driving 91 Camry for long time and it's quality deeply impressed me .
 While I love the design, the poor components, sub, par fit, and, finish, poor quality control, and unreliable work on the part of dealership techs will make me question the quality of any future Toyota vehicle .
 I love the car's visual and aesthetic design, but quality is just as important and for that reason, I would NOT recommend the new Camry to anyone !
I had always heard that Toyota had the best quality cars .

"Great Location ,  Nice   Rooms ,  Helpless Concierge
 The rooms were bright, clean and the windows open .
 Another odd thing we noticed is a majority of the room doors opened OUT into the hallway, rather than into the rooms .
 The rooms are on the small side but they're still big enough to be comfortable and are decorated very nicely .
 The rooms were spacious and clean .
 The rooms are clean and tidy .
 The location was perfect for perusing the shops at Fishermans Wharf, we had dinner at Nicks's Lighthouse ,  the food was fine but the rest rooms were in a horrendous state, which completely put us off .
 The rooms were nice, very comfy bed and very clean bathroom .
 rooms somewhat small but clean and comfortable .
 Although we arrived after 3pm, rooms were not ready and we were asked to wait .
 We had 2 rooms, both were clean and ok, but strangely set up   and sparstly equiped not enough hangers, towels, etc .
We stayed here for 2 nights, the rooms are lovely, very clean, modern, and comfy !
 My room was supposedly upgraded to a larger room, but if this was the case I'd hate to see the smaller rooms .
 If all the rooms are as small I would not want to stay for a long time .
Good Location Small Rooms Some charm
 Free internet in the lobby but none of any sort in the rooms .
 Rooms are quite small if you need two beds but prettily decorated and adequate .
 The rooms were nice and the staff was very friendly .
 Had read some reviews about small rooms ,  but what do you need the extra space for ?
 The rooms are clean and reasonably sized .
 Rooms are very comfortable and we were charged $15 for parking our motorcycle in the garage .
 The rooms were clean and updated, the beds were comfortable, and the bellman service was fast and efficient .
 Rooms were clean and had typical amenities .
 The rooms were clean and well, cared for .
 Although the rooms are small it was very clean .
We arrive early and while they were not able to give us 2 rooms right away, they gave us one right away .
 We'd seen some reviews saying the rooms that face the street are noisy, so by asking for a room off the street, we got a very quiet room .
 The location is good and the rooms are very pretty and clean .
 We were five people with two rooms .
 We had street side rooms and all night long there were busses and loud noises so no one got good sleep .
 Although the rooms are not huge, our room was still easily big enough for 2 adults and a child   .
 The rooms were nice   clean .
 The rooms are exceptionally clean and also the bathrooms .
I'm not sure why so many people say the rooms are small here, but our standard king size bed room was huge in my opinion .
The rooms were smallish and could get a little damp if you didn't keep the air conditioning unit on, but the beds were comfortable, and the courtyard, view room we had was very quiet .
 I agree with other travelers that the rooms are small, and the street noise is sometimes annoying .
The rooms we had were a good size and clean .
 I did have to search through the usual online websites to find the best deal for rooms, but if you take time to look, I think you will be happy with the rates you get .
 The Hotel   rooms are very clean and great food at their resturant .
pthe only negative thing's i will say is that the coffee maker in the room is a dreadfull waste of space and thee coffee pods and i stick of sugar and 2 pouches of milk a day is ridiculas there are no tea coffee making facilitys in the rooms to be honest as the coffee maker is just plain crazy .
 The rooms are decorated well, not too flashy and yet still modern .
 Yes, the rooms aren't that big, but after deciding that our main goal was to find a nice clean hotel close to Fisherman's wharf and near a lot of the public transportation, it was a perfect choice for us .
We arrived from LA having paid the rooms in advance but were immediately hit by a $40 day surcharge to park our car .
The rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .
Parking is expensive, Rooms are on the small side .
 The rooms are probably smaller than at a major chain, but you're not here to sit in your room .
 The rooms are done in an Italian hue, and recently new carpet through out the entire hotel and our floor .
 The rooms were large and comfortable and the location was fine if you don't mind a little walking to the Wharf and other attractions .
I don't know about the street view rooms but we had no problems with noise whatsoever .
The rooms were pleasant, clean and did not disappoint .
 Perhaps they like to let out all the 'close to lift ' rooms to be kind to housekeeping ?
Booked two rooms on Priceline for $139 each, just an overnight stay while flying home the next morning .
 Check in was good, rooms both ready, and we upgraded with no problems .
 older hotel with smaller rooms but updated nicely .
 It was pretty small, so I'm sure the standard rooms are even smaller !
 The rooms are very nice and seem recently upgraded .
 We have stayed at this hotel once before, a few years ago, so knew that the rooms were not particularly large .
 Some say the rooms are small, but ours wasn't that tiny .
 A normal size hotel room compared to other hotel rooms we have stayed in, besides we didn't spend much time in the room when there is so much to do around San Francisco .
 The rooms were small, very small .
 The staff at the hotel more than made up for the tiny rooms .
The only other negative and its a small one, was the size of the rooms,they are tiny but were cleaned well and were ready when we returned every day .
 The rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable .
 They said they noticed we had three people so had automatically provided a cot to our room, I was told they were full and there were no other rooms available .
 The rooms were a little bit tired and with the simple expedient of renewing the wallcovering would show a great improvement .
 The bed was comfortable and the rooms and bathrooms were kept clean and although the refrigerators are honour bars the hotel is happy for you to chill your own drinks in them .
The rooms were nice, comfortable, and clean .
 Our rooms faced the street rather than the courtyard and the traffic ,  especially the motorcycles ,  were loud all night long .
 I suggest you request a room facing the courtyard even numbered rooms, I think ?
Very comfortable beds and rooms ,  nice decor !
 rooms are clean,new, quiet, and relaxing .
 Be sure to ask not to be put in the rooms right above the driveway entry .
 Rooms are small, but they have everything you need .
 The rooms are abit smallish  , but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities .
Really enjoyed the friendliness of the staff and the big rooms .
Great rooms  great staff  great hotel
 The hotel had nIce, well, decorated, fairly, modern rooms .
Excellent location friendly staff clean and pleasant rooms
I was forwarned to expect small rooms, but I thought the Tuscan Inn had rooms typical or even generous for an urban hotel , exceeded my expectations .
 Rooms nice, beds very comfortable !
we found a friendly staff through out the hotel great location,rooms were small but as pointed out to me all land is prime in the area and all places have small rooms .
00am because our ventilation started clicking non, stop, , repair person came, suggested we just move rooms .
 But, we couldn't move again because there were no other rooms available with king .
 The beds very comfortable, rooms tastefully decorated and were very clean and comfortable .
 The rooms were nice but not spectaular .
The location  the rooms  the staff  the concierge  the Managers nightly wine reception    everything about this hotel made our holiday MAGIC .
 Currently   they are remodeling some rooms on the upper floors, and there is considerable construction noise in some areas that started after 9 :
 I am so dispapointed that I can't remember what room # it was becasue apparantly after reading other reviews, there are some newer and nicer rooms .
 The rooms are large comfortable and well furnished, suitable for business travelers or tourists .
The pics of the rooms are the same as they present them online .
 I thought the rooms were good .
 different rates for their rooms .
 The hotel was clean, quiet, large rooms and very close to the Wharf and local restaurants .
 Rooms were a bit small and appear to be older construction, rooms facing the road are a bit noisey at AM rush hour so we requested to be moved to the courtyard side which was a good move .
 The rooms were decent size, clean and had all of the basic amenities .
 I was surprised by the size of it, because we've stayed in other hotel rooms in large cities and the rooms were always tiny .
The travel agent booked this hotel and this was the only hotel out of 10 that I did not book myself although hotel sounded ok This was part of the deal for the airfares  Location is excellent , Rooms Ok Staff variable some very helpful others not so  .
 The rooms   that number 401, 402, 403, 405, 406, 408, 409, 412, 414, and 415 face out to the main street .
Stayed for two nights, there were six of us in three rooms .
Very cleanSmall rooms, but have a couch, chair, desk, etc .
, Get in inside room facing courtyard if you are light sleeper as outside rooms face the streets .
 The rooms seemed to have been recently renovated with updated decor .
The hotel is newly decorated and rooms are a nice size, extremely new and clean .
 The rooms and the double beds were very small, both quite a bit smaller than the Tenaya .
We had booked two connecting rooms since we were travelling with our boys, ages 11   15, and I called several days prior to arriving to remind them of our request .
 We took just one room for that night and they moved us to adjacent, though not connecting, rooms the next two nights .
 Beware, if you request adjoining rooms, they are not guaranteed and really not even planned .
 They told me they don't assign rooms until the day of check, in, and they were also overbooked .
Great location clean rooms we enjoyed our visit .
 The rooms are a bit small, but not uncomfortably so .
This hotel offers clean, well, kept rooms which are good value for money .
 The staff was very helpful and the rooms were well apportioned .
 The rooms are a bit small for more than three adults .
 Apparently the inner rooms have the wall units .
 The rooms were clean, nicely decorated, and comfortable .
 We made our reservations several months ahead of time and requested two adjacent double rooms as my husband and I were travelling with our two teenage daughters .
 They gave us two rooms on the same floor but on opposite sides of the hotel .
 We've gone many places and made this request and this hotel is the first one that did not put us within a couple rooms of each other .
 Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .
Great place to stay ,  very clean and confortable rooms and helpful staff .
 I would recommend this hotel as a good base for a short break to San Fran ,  the hotel rooms weren't the biggest so a longer stay might not be as enjoyable
 I asked the desk clerk when we checked in if the rooms were as small as they said they were in the reviews .
 The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .
 In our opinion, a bit of faux Italian d<e9>cor, some nice throw pillows on the bed and smaller than average rooms doesn<U+0092>t really stretch to <U+0093>European, style Boutique Hotel<U+0094> .
 I asked the front desk whether we could move rooms .
 The woman was very helpful and said that as they had declared a number of rooms non, smoking she could offer me a room on the 2nd floor which would be much quieter as it faced a wall .
 Alarm bells rang in my head when she said they had made rooms non, smoking but I agreed to go and look .
 She told me that due to the high number of non, smoking rooms requested they had to make more rooms available .
 Also, avoid rooms on the ground floor facing Mason Street <U+0096> not only will the street noise be terrible but there is a permanent smell of stale urine along that sidewalk .
 Boudin Bakery an excellent nearby option for breakfast lunch and with Trader Joes right next door you should not need to avail yourself of the very expensive mini bar in the rooms .
 The rooms were cozy, very tastefully done and included a fantastic bed .
The hotel was nicely decorated and so too were the rooms .
 Rooms are small but very quaint .
Upon arriving late through no fault of our own and finding our room double booked we were put up in a nearby sister hotel   until our room was ready the next day and they give us a complimentary bottle of champagne ,  after this though there were no more snags and everything went great ,  hotel staff friendly and helpful ,  rooms were quiet, clean and comfortable ,  food in the restaurant fabulous ,  the situation of the hotel was very convenient ,  just a few mins walk from fishermans wharf with a public transport stop, supermarket, small shops, bars and cafes also really close at hand ,  approx 10 mins walking distance for ferries to alcatraz and bay cruise, etc ,  would definitely stop here again
 Rooms good, decor very well done in Italian style Tuscan !
 Rooms very impressively decorated and clean .
the beds are great, several good pillows and the rooms are super .
 The furnishings are superb, rooms comfortable, and the icing on the cake was that every evening between 5 and 6pm they put on wine and beer tasting with nibbles for all the guests in the lounge !
 The rooms are just a tad bit small, , , but we didn't spend much time in our room .
 We were both delighted with the friendly staff, clean rooms and very convenient location .
 I loved the shampoo and soap in the rooms .
 The rooms' furniture and amenities were quite nice .
 Rooms are small but tastefully done, very clean and the staff friendly and helpful .
 Nice rooms, a bit on the smaller side, but parking right at the hotel .
 The rooms themselves are quite small but clean .
 We ended up with two interior connecting rooms, though the price was more than advertised on the website .
 Yes, the courtyard rooms are dark, but we weren't there much during the day anyway .
 Though small, the rooms were clean and nicely decorated .
 The rooms that face the streets are very noisy due to tour buses, local buses and traffic .
 Couryard rooms are darker than street rooms .
The rooms were very nice and clean .
 the hotel itself is very nice with the rooms large and comfortable .
 location, friendly staff, beautiful rooms and comfy beds .
 It's just 2 tiny rooms with a king bed in one and a pullout sofa in the other with a connecting door .
Downsides are disinterested staff, bordering on rude and quite small rooms .
 The rooms were gorgeous, decorated in black, white, red and some green here and there .
 I'm a travel agent so I'm pretty picky about my hotel rooms but I have to say I will be suggesting this hotel to my clients .
 The rooms are on the small side but if your not traveling with a big family or a lot of luggage, these rooms are just fine .
 Our rooms were of adequate size, very clean and as requested overlooking the courtyard area, which was very pretty .
 The rooms are spotless and the employees are as nice as you could ever want .
 Ask to see a few rooms before you check in, because the room size and location can vary between floors and sides .
BUT ,  the external facing rooms can be noisy from traffic, so make sure you request an internal room, facing the courtyard .
 The hotel has 4 levels with a variety of King, Double, King Suite and Double Suite rooms available .
 This was not what we wanted but there were no rooms with 2 regular beds and it was late at night .
 Great clean rooms with a fantastic shower !
 Rooms are a bit tight especially if you get the two doubles .
 Also, we got connecting rooms, but check first because there are only so many available .
The rooms are pretty standard size, were nice and clean, and comfortable .
Our family of five stayed in two rooms at the Tuscan Inn for two nights during the first week in January .
 It seems to be an older hotel, with the resulting small rooms, but is very attractive .
 Although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems ,  the phone didn't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat didn't work properly .
 The rooms are a bit small, but not unusual for San Francisco .
 It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .
 The rooms were quite small but well set out and our room looked into the courtyard .
 As previous reports suggest the rooms are a bit smaller than some other hotels we have stayed at but we were only there to sleep .
 The rooms, although a little on the cramped side, were tastefully furnished and immaculate .
 It represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly .
 The rooms are equipped with minibars and air, con .
 We checked out the adjacent Holiday Inn Express ,  rooms of equivalent price and size but no mini, bar and, though air, conditioned, no persistent drone when in the &quot off&quot  position ,  though request a room at the front ,  a streetcar line runs at the back and those drivers love to ring the bell !
 We joked about the rooms being sound proof since we never heard other guests and we slept great .
 Apparently, all the rooms are similarly afflicted .
 Streets in the neighborhood carry a lot of traffic, and rooms on the streetside might be too noisy for your tastes .
 The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows   towels and smiling service .
 I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .
 We stayed there with another couple in 2 rooms .
 I was totally amazed that the other guests didn't budge out of the way so we could get to our rooms .
 Our rooms were very small but beautifully decorated .
 Some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom .
 While the rooms were lovely for that price they were extremely small, but the location was just perfect .
 The rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink .
 It is in a great location, the staff is always alert and courteous, the rooms are clean, the morning coffee and biscotti are a nice touch, the happy hour is a PLUS, and the price is right  !
 The rooms are comfortable, clean and nicely furnished .
 The rooms were very nice ,  it wasn't the usual beige hotel room which made a nice change .
 The rooms were clean and nicely decorated .
 The rooms were also quiet and we felt safe .
 The rooms were celan and well kept .
Arrived before check in and was told that two courtyard rooms were reserved for my party and available at 3 :
40 and my rooms were not even ready .
 Upon entering our rooms, we see that our view was not of the courtyard, but of a brick wall .
 Their response was that there were no courtyard rooms available .
 Why they promise two rooms with a courtyard view, when they don't even have one to offer is beyond me .
I feared the room size because of the other reviews, but I think we got lucky and received one of their larger rooms .
The rooms were freshly and creatively decorated, and meticulously clean .
A wonderful stay, staff especially friendly, complimentary wine tasting a definite plus, rooms well appointed and well kept .
 Extremely comfortable rooms, with minibar, TV, alarm clock, ironing board and iron, moring newspaper .
 Our rooms were so much nicer then we expected and the staff was friendly and helpful .
 Contrary to the comments of a previous reviewer, I never saw the rooms advertised anywhere as having 2 queen beds !
 The rooms are extremely clean and have windows that actually open to the outside .
 We never heard a sound from other rooms besides the door next to ours opening and closing .
 One of the smallest rooms in any Best Western I have stayed in .
 We asked at front desk and then said they would send someone up in 10 minutes, over 1 hour later no sign so we asked to move rooms .
Got to hotel, disappointed in the incredibly small rooms, but location is great .
 Website also said rooms had been recently redecorated ,  guess they forgot our 2 rooms ,  kind of shabby .
 Asked next morning ,  still told we couldn't empty them ,  offered to pull up website on our laptop which still showed that fridges came with rooms but they didn't want to see it ,  they just wanted to say that there rooms never had fridges and didn't know why BW advertised that they did .
 It was actually two rooms, with a sofa bed, desk, coffee table, and television in the first room, and a bed, dresser, and television in a seperate room .
 They did switch rooms eventually and even the bellhop thought it smelled horrid in the room .
Small rooms, we could barely fit two adults and two children in the room .
 It is in a great location, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the managers wine hour is a welcome bonus .
 While this was an older hotel, it has been kept up well and the rooms were satisfactory .
 The rooms were great and the Service wonderful .
The rooms and building are quite nice ,  location is excellent .
The rooms were clean and well appointed ,  the maid staff were excellent .
My family stayed at the Tuscan Inn April 20, 25 in two connecting rooms .
 The reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms   .
 Nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom .
great rooms fantastic location and great service !
My husband and i stayed here for 2 nights in march, I was concermed by the number of comments regarding the size of the rooms ,  yes they are a little on the small size but as there was only 2 of us plus my toddler daughter we found them to be more than adequate and very family friendly particularly liked the lock on the mini bar fridge door which housed a seemlessly endless supply of candy !
 A warm welcome on arrival and a nice suite although the rooms were quite compact, however I understand this is common in Fishermans Wharf  .
Apart from that, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the rooms were nicely decorated, and the beds were very comfortable .
 the rooms are very clean and are charmingly appointed  the staff could not be friendlier, and they knock themselves out to make guests feel welcome .
 The hotel is an Italian mediterrean theme everywhere, entrance, lobby, garden courtyard, restaurant, and rooms .
 The staff were helpful and attentive, the rooms were quite spacious and the whole place looked as if it was cared for .
 We had rooms that opened onto the garden and they were quiet .
 the rooms are small but very nice .
 Not the best place to be with kids, , smallish rooms, overpriced restaurant   and no pool, but I would stay there again if it were only the 2 of us .
 Rooms were a bit small but very clean and nicely maintained .
 Took the advice of other past guests and asked for 4th floor rooms which were very quiet .
 The room was clean, warm and comfortable but don't expect a great view from any of the rooms .
 Rooms   were cosy but had everything you wanted inc .
 the wooden blinds don't keep the rooms dark enough once the sun rises, street noise was a bit loud I bought a set of ear plugs .
 The rooms on the outer perimeter do get some street noise, but that didn't keep us from sleeping well .
 The price prohibited booking 2 rooms, which we had done in Vegas and Anaheim .
 We glimpsed rooms containing 2 Queen beds and they seemed to have more space .
The rooms were tiny and still decorated in the 70s style .
 We have 4 children and we booked two adjoining rooms .
 I agree with other reviews that the rooms were on the smaller side, but we thought the hotel was great overall .
 Yes, the rooms were small for the money paid but the location was wonderful .
 The rooms are nice but small and ask for a room that faces the courtyard .
 The staff was friendly and helpful, the beds were comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the location was convenient .
 While some have commented that the rooms are small at the Tuscan, that was not an issue for us .
we were there to see the city, not hang out in our hotel rooms !
 Clean and well, appointed rooms were a bit smallish for a family of four,  , but as one previous reviewer indicated, we spent most of our time out and about .
The rooms are very clean, spacious and quiet   .
 The rooms are small but attractive .
 I reserved two rooms, one for my son and his girlfriend, and one for myself .
 More intimate, close personal attention from the staff and exceptionally clean rooms .
 The rooms are nicely appointed with an honor bar that is not outrageously priced .
 The price was great, the staff was awesome, and the rooms were clean .
 The hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus .
The rooms are clean and comfortable although mine   could have been bigger .
 The rooms were a little smaller than what I was use to but I believe that is common in San Francisco .
 And value is key for the rooms and the service !
 The rooms are sometimes small, but when you're in San Francisco, you don't spend much time in it .
 The service is always great and the rooms very clean .
 Am sorry for those few noisey rooms that some folks got saddled with .
 The rooms are very clean and very well appointed .
","rooms_bestwestern_hotel_sfo","Good rooms but a little small.","The rooms were small.
The rooms were clean.","Rooms were very clean and nicely decorated.
Rather small though.","Rooms can be on the small side, but are nice, clean, and well maintained.","Good, clean and tidy rooms and bathroom.
Little small in size for a long stay but made up by a very friendly staff."
"The Swissotel is one of our favorite hotels in Chicago and the corner rooms have the most fantastic views in the city .
 The rooms look like they were just remodled and upgraded, there was an HD TV and a nice iHome docking station to put my iPod so I could set the alarm to wake up with my music instead of the radio .
Great rooms staff and location but extras overpriced .
 Hotel was very clean and the rooms were comfy .
 the standard rooms are small, the lobby bar is very small   .
 My son loved the Chicago river view from our 31st floor , rooms where neat and clean .
 The rooms were small and much more expensive .
 I've olny ever stayed in the 'standard' rooms in this property, all of which are spacious and airy, and function well for both business or leisure travellers .
 Rooms all appear to either look out onto the river and the bustle of Chicago or, on the other side, will face Navy Pier,   .
 But we really did spend very little time in our rooms .
 The rooms were cleaned spic and span every day .
 But I guess they have to make money somehow since they practically give their rooms away .
 We were 2 rooms away from the elevators but could hear them clearly .
 Building is shaped like a triangle and only has about 17 rooms on a floor, so very quiet and no hall noise .
 The hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky, and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy .
 The view from the rooms is of the river and city, Lake Michigan or of Millennium Park .
 The rooms were great, the staff was excellent .
 The location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and local bars restaurants on the golden mile, and views from most rooms very good .
Very impressed with rooms and view !
 They have just recently upgraded the hotel rooms and they are wonderful .
 The rooms are bright and airy with wonderful beds and bedding .
 The ideal location   coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .
 Very pretty rooms with an European flair .
 no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor .
 Locker rooms were clean and had a sauna .
 Rooms are good quality and clean, what you would expect from a four star business hotel .
 The rooms are large, the view was wonderful overlooking Navy Pier .
 The rooms are very nice , the location is excellent, but the service is Terrible !
 The rooms are spacious and pristine with pillow, top beds that made it almost impossible to get up in the morning because it was so comfortable .
 We stayed in two rooms on the 22 floor in August with our two teenage daughters .
The view from the rooms was fantastic,My daughters are allergic to feathers and all trace of them were removed from the room as soon as we advised housekeeping .
The rooms were spotlessly clean and serviced each day .
We   and, unfortunately, got to stay in three different rooms .
 The rooms are very nice, well, appointed, with comfortable beds .
 The recent renovation is great , ,  the guest rooms are really nice .
 The rooms were large and clean .
 The rooms are very clean, comfortable and spacious and up, to, date .
 Rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 .
 It does suffer, however, from a trend that I have been noticing that as rooms at business class hotels are upgraded ,  particularly with a patch panel for the big LCD, TV ,  drawer space becomes less and less .
 Why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?
The rooms were nice, clean and updated .
 Had to move rooms and floors .
 Our rooms   were still not ready by 8pm .
the other two rooms were not clean .
 They didn't charge us for the room, , , , but, also did not offer any type of compensation to the woman who arranged these rooms in FEBRUARY .
 I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the rooms .
 The room was two rooms from the elevators and I could still hear them but it wasn't too bad .
The hotel and rooms were very clean .
Great Location Nice Rooms Loved the Swissotel !
 The rooms were very clean, the service was polite and helpful, and it's near the heart of Chicago !
 Thanks to TravelZoo I was able to find an amazing deal ,  lakeside rooms for $129 night as part of a spring promotion .
 The hotel looks like an office tower, the rooms look like converted boardrooms and the place has all of the charm of a Fortune 500 executive suite .
 The rooms were clean and modern .
 I ended up with a double on the 7th floor ,  I would've preferred a King since I was alone, but it was one of the renovated rooms so I decided to keep it .
 The rooms are large and well, appointed  , the staff was very professional and friendly, and the view was striking !
Great location but rooms need some work .
 All on the way from Milwaukee I was telling her how everyone was so nice and the rooms are beautiful .
 He then told me that they have no more rooms available and i was just going to have to deal with it since i was only staying a night .
 I called from my cell phone and asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes its blah blah blah .
 When I got to the room, I thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them, but I guess those come later   .
I did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which I think is rediculous .
 There were no king rooms available when we checked in and the woman at the front desk was not overly helpful until we produced a copy of our confirmation wtih the king bed request on it .
 very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to Michigan Ave through via the lower level walkway to the Illinois State center, beds were comfortable .
 The actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude .
 The rooms are spacious and have nice views, I was NOT impressed with the mattress and every, little, tiny thing costs money .
 Very well equiped, the rooms are spacious and very comfortable with every thing you need .
 from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .
 We even got upgraded to one of the corner rooms   which also looked west toward Michigan Ave and the Wrigley building .
 as the building rises the noise will get worse as they get closer to guest rooms .
I<U+0092>ve stayed with my family at the hotel previously in two connecting rooms which were nice but unremarkable .
 This time, no connecting rooms were available so we booked a one, bedroom, 1 .
 In our case, it was cheaper than two connecting rooms and a far better experience .
 Rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .
 Rooms in this hotel are noisy though .
I called in a few hours before check in time to see if any rooms were available for check, in, the operator connected me to the reservations desk .
 Got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet .
The rooms were sleek and cool ,  great views .
 I recieved a great deal on the rooms here and it was wonderful .
 It was a good hotel, the rooms were clean and there were little things like dressing gowns that were a nice touch but other everyday things let the hotel down .
 Our rooms were nice and didn't look worn or old .
 The rooms were comparable but I have to admit I loved the Fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk .
 The rooms are in pretty shabby condition, but they are clean .
 While the rooms are a bit dated, the location is great .
The bad side is that the rooms are dated and in need of some upgrades, but for $109 a night through Travelocity it was great .
 Since we were staying during busy Memorial weekend all the good rooms filled up quickly .
 Our family of 4 frequents Chicago and oftentime forgoes the comfort of a more spacious suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and Navy Pier that Swissotel's Lakeview rooms provide .
 You can see downtown and or the Navy Pier from most of the rooms .
Great Location great rooms and bed but no help from desk personnel .
 There is simply no better way to experience the 4th of July in Chicago, than in one of the corner rooms with a view of Navy Pier .
 Rooms very spacious and clean .
Large rooms and excellent service .
 The interior of the guest rooms is decidedly generic, lacking the style of some of Chicago's newer hotels   .
 But the rooms are large and nicely equipped with all the essentials of a business hotel .
 It seems most of the rooms here have great views and mine was no exception .
 It could be an excellent property if the rooms were updated with new mattresses, televisions and desks .
 The Fairmont and Hyatt next door have a few rooms with a view but not many .
 Suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies, I immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .
 These rooms are right next to the elevators .
 Contemporary in its decor, the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are very nice .
 For 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so I was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .
 I originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .
the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !
The rooms were clean, and upscale for the low price we paid .
Great Hotel with Great Rooms .
 The rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown Chicago standards .
 Most importantly, the rooms were quiet .
 The rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .
 The hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .
I would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .
 The decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .
 The Swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .
 We had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced Lake Michigan   There's some construction right now Southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .
 So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .
 Some of the other hotels in the same class in Chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don<U+0092>t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the Swissotel has .
 Rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .
 The beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .
 We didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .
 From talking to other guests, I concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !
One thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .
 I pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .
 Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !
 Then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .
 The hotel was very nice, rooms were big, the pool hot tub area was very nice, and the location was great and easy to get to .
 It is true that the rooms have a little 'wear', but not to the point of being a problem .
 Rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby .
 word to the wise, , avoid the rooms ending with 11 .
 Rooms were clean, good sized and great views of Navy Pier .
 The rooms were very clean and spacious .
 While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago .
 So, while the rooms are very nice, I will never stay at a Swissotel again, in any city .
 Then again, the rooms are much larger and the view more than makes up for it .
 The room was huge as hotel rooms go .
 Rooms are lovely as well, with handsome fixtures and furniture, a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed .
 Rooms were very comfortable and spacious with nice furniture, comfy bed, luxurious bathroom, great TV, etc .
 There's also an indoor pool, large excercize room, and spacious men's and women's locker rooms on the top floor with floor, to, ceiling windows all around you .
 The rooms are not all that big .
 In fact we have always gotten the rooms with a view of the fireworks !
 The rooms are spacious and I've never had any problems with noise,  they are much quieter than other hotels I've been at .
 I called the front desk before we even set our suitcases down and asked if we could switch rooms .
 At this point it was close to 2 pm and my first fear was that my family and I would be stranded in Chicago with no available rooms at a reputable hotel .
 The views were amazing, the rooms were comfortable and the staff was always helpful whenever I had a question .
 The views are fabulous, the rooms clean and roomy .
 Large clean rooms and comfortable bed .
 These rooms are very speceous and the beds are very comfortable .
 The rooms were nice and the view was pretty good .
 Exceptional rooms and service !
 Hotel's architecture is nice, location near all point of interets and rooms are large, clean, quiet .
 We showed them our Wyndham By, Request card and were told for doing this one of our rooms would be given a complimentary upgrade to a conceirge level room ,  not both rooms but one room .
 Strange, we thought, since we had booked conceirge level rooms .
The rooms with the Navy Pier view are beautiful and the restaurant on the lower level, Currents, was an excellent dining experience .
 Alot of the common areas that I enjoyed so much   have been turned into areas such as large banquet rooms .
 The rooms were clean and big and the view of the navy pier was incredible .
 Expensive Parking but great rooms .
 Rooms were nicely furnished .
 Pool is nice with whirlpool and saunas in the locker rooms .
 The rooms are business, oriented, so they are not as hip or stylish as, say, the Sutton Place or the W .

"We arrived at 23,30 hours and they could not recommend a restaurant so we decided to go to Tesco, with very limited choices but when you are hingry you do not careNext day they rang the bell at 8,00 hours to clean the room, not being very nice being waken up so earlyEvery day they gave us a candy bar and two bottlets of water whic is a very nice touch .
 We had a room with two double beds which was surprisingly roomy, considering the small hotel rooms I have in previous trips to London .
The room was quiet, clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the service was adequate .
 We arrived about 11 am, room was ready .
 Room was good size for Europe ,  clean throughout .
 The Concierge desk called our room to ask if we needed any information or assistance .
 Room was plenty big enough and clean and tidy, bed was comfordable .
First, we walked in and the restroom door was broken .
 Our room was typical holiday inn the bathroom could have done with updating but was spotless .
 Our rooms were not ready, we were promised rooms at a later time, etc .
 My room   was positively huge by European standards .
 The bed was perfectly comfortable, I had ample desk space for my work and my bathroom was much bigger than I expected .
 My friends were given a two bed room which was considerably smaller but, like mine, was clean and stocked with the necessities .
 Early check, in only allowed  smoking  room, but it was entirely acceptable, and only the hallway had faint smke odor .
Rooms in the hotel are very small, as is the double bed .
 The room was tired with peeling wallpaper although it was renovated recently .
 It is common across Europe to have small rooms and this was small for a double .
 The public areas are fine if bland, the rooms comfortable if slightly cramped, the location good for tube and bus but just a little 'distant' .
 The rooms have an electric tea kettle and the tea and cream is provided .
 The room was clean but tired as were the public areas that we saw .
 The bedroom, although recently upgraded with a new bed   had wall paper that was unstuck at the seams throughout the room and the rest of the furniture appeared the quality of a budget hotel brand ,  the TV was an outdated model .
 The room was quiet apart from the hum of the minibar .
 The room was packed to capacity with queues at the food buffets .
 The over zealous   staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .
 Room was comfortable, very well lighted, and well maintained by housekeeping staff .
 Only negative was that the room, fitted with twin beds, was small even for just two adults .
 The hotel was clean and the room was a decent size .
Paid for an executive room and it was not big enough for a family of 3 .
 There was no room once sofa bed was down as we had to climb over it to get to toilet once our daughter was in bed .
 Room and bathroom was very clean .
 After many phone calls and visits to the front desk regarding not being able to connect with the internet I was finally told it was not working in our room and they knew that it wasn't when we checked in .
 But I really liked the hotel ,  the rooms were decently sized, there was a nice bank of lifts in the lobby, and again, the staff was friendly, which goes a long way when you've just got off a ten hour flight .
 Our room was spacious by London standards and had all the amenities we needed .
 Also, one of my colleagues wanted to leave his room key for his wife but the front desk staff wouldn't allow him to do so .
 Our room was smaller than expected .
 I have experience with the small size of some European hotels, but this hotel room was the smallest I have encountered .
 The price we paid for our rooms was reasonable .
The double room is small as in most of London and only one person can walk by the bed at a time .
 There were a few marks and rips on wallpaper etc but overall room was in good shape and both room and bath were clean .
 The rooms were small but adequate and the empty fridge was a great ammenity .
 The room was spotless with a nice selection of toiletries in the bathroom which were re, stocked each day, also the bottle of water, fresh orange and kit kat chunky left each day was a nice touch too .
Bedrooms were fine for what was needed   and when a feather pillow was requested I was greeted with a friendly confirmation it was on its way .
 Rooms were well insulated from outside noise .
 firm, comfortable beds  windows that open  adequate mirrors  clothes drying line across bathtub  sinks and showers drained properly  stopper in sink sealed, which was good because we did our own laundry  night shades overlapped the window and each other enough to keep light out  mini, bar refrigerator ran quietly  free newspapers daily in elevator waiting areas  in, room safe  American sized wash cloths  all lights worked  enough electrical outlets  enough hangers  central air conditioning which worked and ran quietly  adequate elevators  no toilet problems  shower curtains sealed water from leaking onto the floor  anti, slip surface on bathtub shower  exhaust system in bathroom removed condensation from shower  always enough hot water in shower .
 Our room rate included two full breakfasts, free bottled water and Kitkat candy bars each day and was very competitive with the rates at other hotels we considered .
 Not sure what the regular rate is for a room, but I personally would not pay more than $100 for this hotel .
 In, room internet is outrageously expensive at 15 pounds   per day .
The room was clean,tidy a good size and extremly quiet .
 I made the reservation 2 moths ago requesting for 2 connecting rooms and was told could not guarantee connecting rooms until later .
 She called housekeeping, and the room was ready in 10 minutes !
 The room was a perfect size, spotlessly clean, and well equipped   .
after returning from our dinner the staff had left a bottle of wine in the room and a card wishing us a happy anniversary, such a lovely touch !
 They currently appear to be renovating the rooms once this is one I am sure it will be even better !
Had requested a double room, not available at time of booking and no notes in the reservation about this but we could have had a double if we had wanted to wait .
The room was about what we expected from a Holiday Inn although we could have used a bottle or can opener given that there was no mini bar .
 We stayed at the beginning and end of our trip, and both times our double room was clean, comfortable, and a good size .
 First was about a short que  , then about that he needed to go to the back room to check out if he could give me a double room instead of single and the thirth time that the printer was slow .
The room was ok, but wallpaper were detahced on few places .
 We were very pleased with our room which also had aircon as it was very hot in London at that time .
 We had two rooms with an interconnecting door which was a perfect arrangement and the accessible room had plenty of room for the wheelchair with a big bathroom   .
My room was good size for European standards, and had recently been overhauled and included hair dryer, fridge, and air conditioning .
 Getting to the rooms was slowed by construction crews working on other floors and a horrible elevator which requires your room key to operate .
 The lobby was big but the room was very small, I won't stay there any more .
 If you upgraded to the next level room, the fridge was stocked .
 Had it not been for the hotel confirmation that I made a copy of they did not want to give us a room even though it was already paid for months in advance .
 My room was very clean, bed was comfy and always made by the time I arrived back each day .
Room size is fine as of European standard, it's clean and tidy .
ROOM and SERVICE ,  our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones .
 Even though I requested a true king or queen bed, our room was a 2 twin that was hastily assembled into a king which meant that one of us was always falling into the gap between the beds .
 The beds were not very comfortable and the door to the bathroom was a sliding door that did not lock .
,  Decor in room was a bit dated .
,  Room was smaller than I thought it was going to be .
 A C either ineffective or not turned on but was just Spring, so room was comfortable cool with window opened for fresh air .
 The room was very reasonably priced, but very small .
 The beds were comfortable, but the bathroom was tiny as well .
The hotel is huge and our room was on the large side for London .
 It was a good quality room although the bed was and pillows were very firm .
 They changed our room for the rest of our stay but the room was not as nice and had a smaller folding bed   .
 What we got was a room where the hotel wall was on the left side and a roof under our window with full of cabbage .
Room wasn't that big but looks like brand new, bed was very comfy   .
 Bathroom also was very clean with no smell of chemistry .
 They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .
The room was tiny, and the heater didn't work properly, The staff if great .
 It is a great location, the rooms are a bit basic, but clean and we actually got a pretty good view this time .
 Let's face it, just because the hotel is 4 star does NOT mean your room will be, but this really isn't too bad .
 The room also had a fridge which is great to store orange juice and anything else you might need, but the fridge really could have used a good scrubbing !
 On the plus side, the staff in the breakfast room was wonderful and friendly, as was the fine waitress the one night we had dessert at the ground, floor restaurant .
 We  upgraded  our room from a standard to an excutive room for and extra 175 pounds   and got a room that was maybe 150 sq ft, the bathroom was tiny and had a pocket door that was heavy and hard to close, the whole room needed to be updated .
 When we tried to use a phone card from our room it would not work so I asked the front dest to help me and was told they couldn't really !
 Our room was small and the wooden furniture was badly chipped and marked .
 I was 'upgraded' to a room that wasn't stunning or large ,  hate to think what regular room is like .
 Not too easy to find rooms for more than two people in London unless you compromise on a few things, such as cost, location etc .
We had an executive room and was disappointed to find that the extra bed was not done up and we had to call housekeeping to fold down the metal bed .
 The room   was very nice with a king size bed and a full size double sofa bed which was very comfortable and easy to use .
 I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .
 I really cannot comment on the rate because we had a package deal for the entire trip, and I don't have a clue what our room rate was .
 Our room was small but tasteful .
 I do wish they had double rooms with double beds, but I was so exhausted when I went to be, I don't believe I even turned over, so I managed with the twin bed just fine .
 The rooms are quite small but everything we needed was there .
 The refrigerator did not work, and when we asked about it were informed that a refrigerator did not come with our room, even though it was in the room .
 After realizing that the room was 'Smoking  we went downstairs to change rooms and they told us the entire hotel was booked .
 The hotel room was very clean and the cleaning staff and breakfast staff were very attentive .
 Check, in was simple, and we made our way to the room in an elevator lift that whisked us up to the 20th floor in a matter of seconds .
 The room was clean, organized, and provided a great view of London .
 The breakfast room is  cattle market  like with queues for tables and at the servery, and we were led to tables that werent free more than onceThe decor is also fairly dated, with a 1970s feel to some of the public areas ,  the lounge bar has the ability to be good but is often used as a waiting area by people, occupying tables without having a drink, and doesnt work as some bars in lobby areas do at other hotels ,  the main bar is like a pub, and doesnt feel like part of the hotel .
 We requested a room on a high floor before we left and this wish was granted with a 15th floor room with a view for miles it was great !
 The room size was as expected, bigger then hotels in south beach, yet smaller then some resorts in the caribbean ,  however that being said, the room size is more than enough and we had several pieces of luggage in the room .
Standard rooms in this hotel fall far short of usual London four, star standard ,  they are small, have no safe, pants press or other amenities usually provided .
 The room was nice size with a small but adequate bathroom .
 The room was clean, the bathroom large enough, and I had a choice of pillows .
 If I had paid more than $100 for my room, I would have been disappointed .
 My husband and I stayed in one of their suites a few years ago over Christmas and the only complaint I had about it was that the sofa in the living room of the suite was as hard as a rock .
 check, in was quick, staff was helpful and rooms were clean  just to be very picky on details, restroom looked like it might have needed some refurbishment sometimes in the near future and also there wasn't actually much spare space in the room, but I assume it wouldn't have been much better in other hotels in London .
 Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .
We were able to find an internet deal and got a double room for about 100<U+0080> night   and I'd definitely suggest you to immediately book this hotel if you're lucky to find some similar offer .
 Check in was very easy, we we happy to learn that our room was ready at 11am and they up graded our room .
 If this is your first time to the UK and you travel a lot in the US, the room size is small .
   The room is very clean and modern, everyday it was cleaned and fresh towels were given even when we didnt put them on the floor .
 The lobby was absolutely heaving when I arrived, mostly tourists but some airline crew too, The room was small, and the tv was too .
 The bathroom was also tiny, and the water pressure abysmally low .
 Bed was comfortable, but the room was very hot, even with the window open .
30 to find our room was ready and the receptionist very helpful and friendly and my special requests had been noted and acted on .
 The room itself was clean but very dated think early '90s blue and yellow with pine !
 But, the room was bright and airy and a decent size .
 When I tried to check in early the receptionist persuaded me to purchase an 'upgrade' to an executive room as that was available but the regular room that I booked wasn't .
 Tiny room, dated furniture, the dirt from my shoes wasn't removed by the cleaners during my stay .
 The room was a little smaller than typical US hotels but very comfortable .
 Staff were very pleasant , especially the breakfast staff  Rooms were not particularly spacious but were clean and adequate, bathroom was modern but shower was not very powerful .
 When I finally got my turn she said four words to me,  name   sorry  I spelt out my name  credit card  I did think for a moment that she might say  Pin  or tell me my room number but obviously i wasnt worth the effort .
The room was a bog standard room, poorly lit with no light on the desk or indeed within 6 feet of it, a noisy aircon heater and a tv that you cant see from the sofa, you have to sit on the bed .
Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a <U+00A3>6 .
, but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .
The room was spacious and clean and the bed comfotable with the option to choose from 5 or 6 different kind of pillows depending on your needs or allergies etc .
 The website offers a standard room for less money, but we were told by the hotel that the only way to be guaranteed a non, smoking room was to upgrade to a King, so we paid extra .
Let me just say that the bed was king size, but the room was tiny and the bed took up most of it .
 It was clean, but the room was rather tired looking and needed to be updated badly .
 People are saying the rooms are small but one I was in was very much the Holiday inn standard size room and was in good condition .
 View was excellent from the room although weather was terrible during my stay .
 The rooms are very small and can feel kind of cramped when changing and stuff is on the bed .
 It was 15 pounds a day for in, room wired access or otherwise you had to buy a BT OpenZone card for 6 pounds for 1 .
Our room ,  and the hotel generally ,  was dated, looking a bit tired .
we ask for the room 10 minutes before check, in time and the room wasn't ready .
 We had a renovated room and it was really lovely and clean .
Now my room was clean, comfortable and the equipment all worked as it should but if this was an executive room then I would hate to have stayed in a standard room .
 Our rooms weren't ready when we arrived  , which was fine  but they also weren't ready for hours after the official check, in time .
 We also requested a room change, but for some reason this never worked out, but then again, we weren't in the room for much time as we were out sight, seeing .
 Mind you, hotel rooms in Europe are smaller than in the States, but this room was MORE than enough room for the two of us !
 Room was an Executive Club floor room and was larger than average for a London Holiday Inn, well laid out and everything worked !
Our room was on the 12th floor .
 I had pre booked my room through the priority club, I'm a platinum member and on checking in the reception told me their was only a twin room left .
 The room was that bad, I did not even unpack .
 Complaining again to reception got me a double room, which they said at check in was not available .
 The room was basic but cold, the heating system did not work at all .
Our room   was very comfortable, cosy and most importantly very clean .
 Rooms were cleaned every day without fail and toiletries and coffee sachets etc replenished .
 Rooms are clean and good size by English standards .
 The room size is actually not bad ,  in fact, it is larger than the room I stayed at the Holiday Inn Regents Park 6 months ago .
The major downside of my room is it faces Cromwell Road and also an exposed section of the Underground   .
The room has a small fridge, which is a bit cold, but is in desparate need of defrosting .
 However, no in, room safe which is a bit disappointing .
Bathroom is a bit small but acceptable .
 However, I'd be sure to request a room AWAY from Cromwell Rd due to the noise issue .
Room ,  clean, good size, everything you need is in the room including the coolerLocation ,  within every attractions, short walk or you can take the double decker just across the street .
 the bathroom door is a slide, door as there is no room for a normal hinged door .
 That said, most London rooms are small and as we were only sleeping there, it was not really a problem .
 There are no ironing facilities in standard rooms but there is an ill, publicised ironing room on floor 26 ,  you'll need to ask for directions .
 OK, the rooms are a bit on the small side, and it's a tad noisy generally of an evening, but what do you expect from a large hotel slap bang in the middle of one of the main arterial routes into London ?
From the time we booked Holiday Inn Forum Kensington I was overcharged some 200 GBP on the fee I was quoted and had some considerable trouble getting this rectified by Holiday Inns central booking officeWhen arriving at hotel in room safe   bar fridge as quoted were not supplied   when I questioned reception they said can't supply a safe but will send fridge up which they did, but for all the good it was with fixed thermostat the drinks we put in it would have stayed cooler outside the fridge .
 Bathroom looked new   was clean .
Nice clean rooms, good value, and average location near a tube station, but the rooms directing towards the main street outside are all VERY noisy .
 The room was immaculate, and perfect .
Booked this room via Lastminute's Secret hotels and is described as an awesome Kensington hotel .
Our first room was adequate, simple and clean .
The room was clean,comfortable and quiet .
 No problem said the receptionist I will fast track your room so it will be available at that time, and here is the key holder with the number of your room for when you return .
15, after a lot of searching on the computer and a long wait, we were informed our family room was not ready would we take a seat and we would be called when it was available .
 30 minutes later we were allocated a room,which was very small for three people, we then discoverd that the bed for my grandson had not been made up, nor was there any extra bedding in the room .
 There was insufficient room for suitcases, the decor was somewhat tired and the room was not soundproof .
 We only had breakfasts in the hotel and were not impressed for it to be served in a room that was not really a restaurant .
 no standard room was available 40 minutes before announced check, in right in time 30 minutes after   .
The room itself was fine for our family of three when the pull out bed for my daughter was closed but a tight squeeze when open !
 Still, the room was comfortable enough  and clean, although some of the fixtures and fittings were slightly worn, e .
For our purposes, the hotel was perfectly adequate ,  the location was good and the room was clean and quiet .
 The rooms are quite small but the problem is they really could use some renovation .
 The rooms were extremely small however and with the couch turned into a bed it was impossible to get from the bed to the bathroom .
 Arrived, didn't get the room we paid for or booked ,  apparently they are allowed to do this and its in the small print !
2,  When I tried to check in 2 days later they simply gave me a single bed room where my reservation was a twin bed room when they corrected it   I went to my room it was a smoking room   I had to go back to change it they said there is no rooms available   I have to sleep the night   they will transfer me in the next day like it was my fault  !
 when i told them that my room is a smoking room   I specified in my reservation that its non, smoking the employee asked me  I wonder how could you specify that    there was other incidents as well .
 The bathroom was small, and water pressure was weak, but it was doable .
 We arrived at the hotel 2 hours before check in, and were delighted when we were offered a free upgrade to a kingsize room, although this was a smoking room, there wasn't too bad a smell, and we just opened the windows .
 The room was a decent size for a London hotel room .
 Overall I couldn't have been more satisfied and far from assigning me a humble room because I'd booked a discounted Hotwire rate, I was given a room upgrade !
 The next day, after coming back from sighseeing at around midnight, we went up to the room after seeing the queue of 8 persons waiting to see the receptionist and amazingly our keys worked and our bags were where we have left them .
 Upon arrival to the room itself, we discover that we have in fact been given a disabled, non smoking room .
 I politely explained about my shock at being given a completely different room than what was booked !
 The room itself was small, though clean and well appointed with a complimentary bottle of wine and water .
 Basic necessities like iron, tea kettle, multiple TV channels, safe deposit lockers, newspaper are always available in the room as standard equipment   and there are no surprises .
 The rooms   toilets are of a certain size and you can settle in quickly, to start discovering the city you<U+0092>re visiting .
 Check, in was super, quick, the rooms was spot, on and breakfast was more than elaborate .
 Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !
The room was very small   but clean, modern and comfortable .
The room itself was dated and the en, suite tiny, but it did have everything you needed for a comfortable stay .
 The hotel room was very clean and housekeeping made up my daughter's bed five minutes after phoning reception .
 The room also has a fridge, which is not really a fridge, but a <U+0093>cooler<U+0094>, as described by staff .
 The bathroom is a good size .
 When we got to the hotel the front desk clerk told us that the double room we booked is not available because their reservation centre had overbooked the hotel .
 She was quick to add, however, that she would be willing to give us a free upgrade to an executive room for 1 night, which would normally cost us GBP35, but for the inconvenience, she would waive this upgrade fee for the first night only .
 In other words, if the room is already hot, you will not be able to cool it down unless you ask that the AC be turned on, or unless you open a window   .
 The room was what we were expecting .
 Room was on 3rd floor but there was a private function in their function suite .
The room we booked was supposed to be an executive room .
 The room we were given was small, poorly funished   it had the smallest bathroom we have ever had in an hotel and the traffic noise went on from about 06 :
 My room was a typical London size i .
 My room was non, smoking and did not smell like smoke .
 My room was clean, although since I only stayed one night I cannot comment about ongoing housekeeping .
 Overall, I would describe the room as free of serious problems, but drab and in need of modernisation or livening up .
 My bathroom was, like the room, small .
 By European standards, our room was large .
 The room was clean and breakfast OK .
When i checked in, i asked to be shown several rooms and the staff was happy to do so .
 Although smokers tend to get relegated to the worst rooms  , i was happy with my 6th floor room .
 We were upgraded to an Executive Room, which was fantastic , ,  double bed, lots of room, couch for extra seating .
 The room also had an  American outlet  which was very useful .
 We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service .
 However, if the room rates were the same and or I was using my Priority Club points I would choose the Holiday Inn Kensington across the street   .
The room was a nice size , very clean and more than adequate .
 Why some people moan about the size of their room is beyond me .
 Yes the rooms are small, but realistically, how much time do you spend in the room ?
 The room I was in was ok, but the shower was terrible .
 The rooms are not well shielded from noise and I had folks yapping away in the corridoor practically all night .
 TV is placed in the room such that, if you try watching for a while, it is guaranteed that you will get stiff neck .
 We booked direct on the hotel website and paid 75 pounds per room per night, which is extremely good for London and for the quality of the rooms .
 We had arrived early and were prepared to wait for our room however we were offered an upgrade to an executive room because our allocated room was not yet ready .
 The room was spacious and comfortable and came with a complementary bottle of wine, water and other refreshments .
The only downside to the room is that is was very hot .
 The room was clean and contemporary .
 The room was actually pretty large compared to other hotel rooms I have seen in London .
 As expected, the room was smaller than the usual American hotel, but clean   quiet with fairly new furnishings .
 The room's refrigerator allowed us to cover several breakfasts   snacks by shopping at the convenience grocery store that was also just a block away, so we skipped the hotel's breakfast .
Small rooms but mine was clean and a lovelycomfy bed .
I got a good deal on this stay ,  2 nights for 123 pounds room only, through the priority club  , as I was coming to stay to go to a concert celebrate my daughters 16th Birthday .
Reception, not too busy when I checked in, my room was ready .
The room was small, but there was a window that opened and good views over london although the windows could do with a good scrub !
 The room was clean, and looked fine .
 There is an empty fridge in the room, ours wasn't working properly, so check if yours is before going down to Waitrose Tesco for chilled items I didn't !
But the room is as I have previously mentioned rather small ,  see the photos, literally just enough room to walk between the bed and the dressing table desk, but so long as you are not intending to spend much time in there you will be OK .
 Broadbadn access in the rooms is fine, but can slow down at peak times of the evening, the cost is also excessive .
 I have to say that the room was a bit small but not uncomfortable .
00am the room was ready for us so we could take a nap to get over the jet lag and head out for an afternoon   evening of sight, seeing so we didn't lose any time due to the time difference .
 The room was clean, neat and very well kept .
 If you are a tourist who will only be in the room to sleep and shower this is the place for you .
Service was friendly, our room was on the highest floor  , but that wasn't a problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .
 The room was average sized, but I'm not paying to swing a cat in a hotel room .
 Instead of an executive room with a king bed and a wonderful breakfast each day at the MG, this trip we paid more to stay at this Holiday Inn and definitely had fewer and less posh amenities .
 We knew the rooms were small, but ours wasn't too small .
Our room was always cleaned very well daily .
 the room is just the smallest darn thing you'll ever see .
 The room is generally spotless and the cleaning ladies do a great job of refilling all of the usual stuff .
 The bathroom was generally spotless throughout .
 however the corridors to our room had a pungent smell of deep heat, walls were covered in marks and the gerenal appearance of public areas is dusty and old fashioned .
 the room we booked was an executive .
 the bathroom was looking tired aswell .
 the second room was exactly the same .
 Room was still a small European style room .
The room was spotlessly clean and in good repair and also being a light sleeper i found it to be very quiet considering the hotel was so large .
All in all a great place to stay for a getaway break in london try and a room on a higher floor overlooking the city it is worth it !
 The room was as expected for a Holiday Inn, cute little fridge with lots of goodies, a teapot, comfortable beds, clean, neatly renovated bathroom, plenty of hot water, overall pleasant .
 Non, smoking room and floor was actually non, smoking !
 Usualy i still smell smoke from somewhere , even on the non, smoking rooms, not this time .
 Our room was very clean, although a bit small  .
 Staff very friendly and I always worry when booking through priceline that I will get the worst rooms because the price was so good but got a great room on the 16th floor facing the London Eye .
 Hotel was able to give us a two bed non, smoking room which is exactly what we wanted .
Stayed here for business , first room was very small but after they changed my room it was fine .
I also got a phone call in the room on the second day from a strange man asking if I had found an ear ring which was lost that day in my room .
 Bathroom was comparable to an average North American hotel, which means fairly big for Europe .
 My room was clean with tea and coffee making facilities, but there was wallpaper coming away from the walls and there was no cover on the bed, simply a duvet in a white sheet .
 I originally asked for a room above the 10th floor looking over London but that side of the hotel was fully booked so got and upgrade to an executive room .
 The room was still small with barely enough room between the bed and dressing table but it did have a sofa and complementary half bottle of wine, fruit juice, water, and chocolate bar at the hotels prices this would of cost of over <U+00A3>20 ,  Chocolate bar is <U+00A3>3 .
 I was booked into the same room as the one I complained about last time and the TV is still not fixed !
 Upon returning to the room after the false alarm, he was nowhere to be seen, so I connected the TV up and put the trolley outside the room .
An ok Hotel if you get a room at a discounted rate .
 The hotel itself is in need of an upgrade, its getting a bit tired, but saying that, the room was clean .
 The room was on the small side, but had a great view of North London   .
 The bathroom was ok, however there seemed to be a lack of water pressure, so the shower was a kin to standing under a tap .
 The bathroom is bright and clean, with a modern tub and good water pressure .
 As a priority club member I expected to have a decent room but this was not the case .
 The room was extremely small .
 Room was small but adequate as I basically used the room to sleep in .
I appreciate that we had a large room so it's difficult for me to comment on comfort of the standard room's, however, the mentality we have is we'd rather spend time exploring, so the size of the room isn't necessarily important .
 The rooms were all modern although for an Executive Room all you basically get extra is a bottle of water, orange juice and robe   .
 Our room was more than comfortable for two but when me made up the third bed the room was incredibly cramped ,  then again this is Central London  !
Another word of warning when booking through the Holiday Inn website ,  VAT was NOT included in the price at the time of booking until you actually processed the booking and paid for the room ,  this is apparently now normal for many London hotels which I'd never experienced before ,  we ended up paying <U+00A3>17 more per night than I'd expected .
 Yes, the standard rooms are small for two people   and, yes, they seem to have a lot of trainee staff at the front desk, who struggle sometimes with the language, and yes some of the rooms are affected by traffic noise, but for a good location and a no, frills room provider, it is hard to beat .
 it was very hard to move around the room when the sofa bed was pulled out   as another reviewer said you'd have to crawl to move around  .
 The rooms that overlook the railway lines can be a little noisy, otherwise I haven't been disturbed by external noise .
 The bathroom was modest in size and had a tub .
 The decor of the hotel and the rooms looks cheapand not worth the money I was paying .
 Our room was clean, spacious and smart .
 Two people couldn't walk within the room at the same time but I guess that is a problem with most hotels in Europe .
 About the hotel, the first room given to us was having stained and patchy carpet and the duvet was also stained .
 The second room's phone did not work, whicch was again changed immediately after reporting .
 The rooms have never disappointed and the food is always nice .
 We stayed at the Holiday Inn for about a week and the room was clean and quiet .
 Yes, the rooms are small but most hotel rooms are small in Europe so this was not a surprise .
 The bathroom is tiny but at least there is a bathroom attached to the room  in a lot of hotels that I looked at online in the same price range, bathrooms were not en suite .
 Despite its size, and the fact that there are over 20 floors of bedrooms, lift service was never slow, and the breakfast operation   is exceptionally well, managed .
 Check in was prompt, and the room clean and tidy, a bit small, but this is central London .
 The room is very small, which is fairly typical for London .
 The room was small but not overly so .
 The rooms are not huge but very clean and quiet, the view from our room was fabulous, and was very bright and cheerful .
 Room wasn't luxurious but did exactly what we wanted in that it was clean and had a comfy bed !
 Room was clean and bathroom was compact and modern .
The room itself was very clean, the bathroom was small but immaculate .
 The luggage facility was superb too, we had no problems in checking out of the room and leaving our luggage which was securely labelled and organised, for no extra cost .
 We booked the room as a triple, and were pleasantly surprised to find three single beds, rather than a double and a sofa bed .
 The room was generally clean .
The bathroom was adequate, and was cleaned each day .
The room was OK, ish, Great view as any other building with 20
 Instead of Mini Bar my room had just the hole where it normally is placed and some hanging cables .
 The room cost GBP245 per night   and the room was very basic, small tv, too soft mattress ie .
 Plus, the bathroom is a good size .
 The rooms are very clean and come with a mini fridge that is empty and can be filled upon request .
 The room was good and functional .
 People asked to be changed rooms all the time and this was not my first time staying in hotels .
 The service at the breakfast room was ok .
 Overall, we found the hotel only good for location and decent room if somewhat cold just like the weather was in London then .
 The room was very clean and was quite big for a London hotel room .
 The room was clean and , by London standards, decently sized .
Stayed in room 516 right at the end of the corridor was next to a services room from which there was a constant generator   fan noise .
 This noise could be heard inside the room and was irritating ,  the television had to be turned up to be heard and so on .
 Otherwise the room was fine for one, but was rather compact and would have been too cramped for two people .
 No other problems ,  the room was clean, the bed was comfortable and everything in the room worked .
The room was a typical Holiday Inn effort but I have to commend the cleanliness ,  nothing broken, damaged or grimey and the bathroom smelt fresh .
 Small, with soft beds the room served well for the night we stayed and the card controlled lift access was a nice feature which made the hotel feel more secure .
 Within the same complex is a Boots and Waitrose so filling the provided in, room fridge with snacks is a doddle .
00 to get a room, need to fill in a form, be careful when order newspapers, they charge you except priority club member, this is not mentioned anywhere on the form, and unacceptable considered it is normally included in many other four stars hotels, paid <U+00A3>140 per night and they asked for another 65 pence for newspapers, cheapskate !
 good size considered it is in london, comfy double bed, clean in room, tea coffee choc making facilities, hairdryer under desk, old tv, toilet facilities was disgusting, long curly black hair in bathtub, big black pubic hair tangled in hand towel, disgusting yellow scum stick on toilet seat, dove shampoo bottle near bathtub and dove cream cleanser bottle near hand basic were both empty, cheap plastic canteen cups on wash basin, only one tiny hand soap, NO supply of essential basic vanity kits   only available if ask, cheap standard chain hotel decor, room was quiet, did not hear anything from the street, but doors closed loudly from nearby rooms on the corridor .
 Once we had access to our room on the 14th floor, we were pleasantly surprised .
 The room was very clean and tidy although a little small .
 I would not pay rack rate for a room here, but it is quite attractive at a discounted price .
 Although my room was only on the fourth floor, the noise, proofing was quite impressive, and I could barely hear street noise from Cromwell Road .
 My room was small but it was clean and everything was okay except for the wireless internet which kept going in and out every 5 minutes .
 In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay .
 Our westward facing room was on the 17th floor, and we saw a couple of beautiful sunsets out the windows, sharing wine and cheese that we<U+0092>d purchased at the Waitrose supermarket a block away on Gloucester Rd or at the Sainsbury supermarket two blocks down Cromwell Rd .
 As others have mentioned, the room is small, a bit bigger than a room on a cruise ship, but it<U+0092>s immaculate, has a small refrigerator, and has a well appointed bathroom with vanity and full tub and shower .
 As other reviewers have remarked, our room was small, and designed for only the purposes of bathing, watching TV, and sleeping .
 In the sliding, door bathroom, there was no hair dryer, common amenities like shower caps, shampoo, etc .
 The bathroom in our room was immaculately clean .
 About the only negative thing I can say about the room, was that when the sofa chair was pulled out into the single bed for the third adult, there was absolutely only about 4 inches between the end of the bed and the desk in order to pass to go to the bathroom .
00 US dollars per night and previously requested a room with 3 beds as we are 3 males who wanted our own beds and I was prepared to pay for the upgrade .
Although smaller rooms are expected in Europe, the room with 3 beds in this hotel is considerably smaller than most standard size US hotel rooms .
 It was not available in our room and was very expensive   to use in the lobby area .
 We did ask for a high room but that was ignored i think !
The room was small, but clean .
 Nothing to say that this room was a  priceline  room .
 The room was kept clean, and restocked with cups, teas, etc as they were used .
 Although we had email confirmation that the room was prepaid, the check in staff insisted that the <U+0093>back office<U+0094> didn<U+0092>t actually take payment and wanted us to pay again .
 So on check out, not only did the staff try to take another payment, they tried to take it at normal room rates and not the discounted rate !
 our room, which was a handicap access room due to the crowded season, was actually a great choice, as the bath is large, light filled and with updated fixtures .
 both rooms were kept very clean during our extended visit .
 It proved good value for a regular room but the advertised extras to justify the  executive   tag were not all there .
Our room was neat and clean with no problems at all .
 Comfortable room with large bed but limited space as is often the case with London hotels, but I found the location excellent .
 The disappointment was that when we got to our room the extra bed was infact a sofa and it was not ready, which at that time of night was quite inconvenient .
 The room was perfectly comfortable with great views, although I wish I was on a higher floor .
 The bedroom was small   but the bathroom was good sized and exceptionally clean .
 There was quite obviously a large choice of rooms available and the female check in receptionist managed to find me a non, smoking twin room with a view of london no problem   all the way over to what I assume to be Hammersmith .
 8am on a sunday morning is a tad early to be ringing the room doorbell, though it is a large hotel and we had forgotten to put the 'do not disturb' sign out .
 that there didn't really seem to be a functioning air vent in our bathroom so it was a bit of a sauna after you used the shower, and 2 .
com 'Mystery hotels' Reception staff freinedly and helpful, requested a quiet room and were given a room on the 17th floor facing the rear of the hotel which was about as quiet as you can expect for central london !
 The bathroom was clean and modern with a sliding door not enough room for a standard door as it would hit the wardrobe !
 Our room had all of the facilities listed including fridge which came in handy .
 There is a fridge in the room but make sure it is plugged in .
 Room was very modern and clean, too, and everything worked bar the kettle which was replaced with a brand new one in 15 minutes .
There are also rooms adapted for people with disabilities which we did not check out but wife   approved of their description in the hotel bumpf .
90 otherwise if you pay in The Forum room on the first floor until we'd been there a day or two  slightly patchy face cloth supply, the one time no, one in maintenance or reception would answer the phone, and the biggie ,  despite the warmest London autumn on record, the a c was switched off   and the room was always too hot .
 We were given a standard double room on the 27th floor which is the top floor .
The room itself was everything you would expect for a 4 star chain hotel .
 Our room was on the 5th floor of this very tall and bunker like hotel building and it faced Cromwell Road .
 The view was good to the south and the room was surprisingly large, with a small refrigerator, desk, TB and double bed .
I'll pass on a few minor issues and tips,  our room appeared to be below a disco .
 The room was small, but very clean, and the bathroom spotless .
 It was nice to have a frig in the room, we bought juice and croisants each morn from a local store and stored them .
  The room was quite small but it was about the size that I expect from hotels in London and it didn't really bother us .
 On arrival we were allocated a twin room and when I called to enquire about changing I was told that there was no record of my request for a double room and that non were available .
The room was uncomfortably small and very tired .
Shabby rooms basic facilties ,  no way is this a Four Star hotel .
 The room itself   was pokey, drab and stuffy .
 There was no fridge or mini, bar, and no toiletries in the bathroom except a refillable soap dispenser which was screwed to the wall .
My husband and I stayed in a double room for six nights this month at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .
 Initially, I was disappointed in the small size of the room, but adjusted to it, and by the time we left ,wondered why I was initially concerned !
 The room was immaculate and the bathroom wonderful .
Rooms are fairly small, but you have to expect this outside of North America .
,  very clean,  quiet,  bathrooms appear to have been updated recentlyThe hotel location is great .
 Even standard staterooms aboard cruise ships were the same size or larger !
 That's a good price even though the room was tiny, however, when it came to the continental breakfast, the hotel would not permit us to partake of same, telling us that because we reserved through Hotwire, we were ineligible for the breakfast .
 Because of the room size, the lack of continental breakfast for those who reserve outside of the Holiday Inn web site, and the distance to many attractions, we WILL NOT STAY in the hotel during our next trip to London .
 Other than that, our stay was uneventful and the room was clean, if a bit small .
 The room was not extravagant, but very comfortable .
 The hotel exterior is a bit plain, but the room was comfortable .
When we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, was informed by reception there was a problem ,  it later transpired that we had been given an Aircrew room, where there is no mini, bar, pay per view movies turned off at reception, no menu's or room service available .
 The room whilst a reasonable size was definitely due for refurbishment .
 The room was clean and comfortable if a bit on the small side .
 The room was very confortable, but rather small   .
 Although the room was small, it was comfortable and clean, , especially the pillows and king size bed !
 The bathroom was also small, and the water pressure in the shower was not great .
I arrived early and the room was not ready, so I took a big bus tour   .
 They moved my stuff to room 1524, which was wonderful .
 The room was much larger than expected with a huge comfortable bed, desk, sofa and ample bathroom .
Don't use the restaurant or room service, there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store   plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick breakfast, the Gloucester Road tube stop is a 3 minute walk, plenty of busses to High Street fabulous shopping !
Furthermore, one of the room given was occupied by someone else and we could not open one room with the key given .
In conclusion, rooms were small but clean, internet charge was expensive   and reception staff booking system was hopeless .
 It was clean, the maids were fantastic, our room was surprisingly large  , and the beds were comfortable .
Our room was small, but very clean and appeared to be newly decorated .
 The room was small, as lower priced rooms tend to be in London .
 But the room was clean, the bathroom was modern with tub and shower and all the hot water we wanted and there was a hairdryer .
 The bathrooms are basic with soap dispensers reminiscent of a gym, but were uniquely clean without dirty corners even to a critical eye .
 Front desk efficient, concierge was busy and helpful, room was adequate and very clean .
If you want a simple and extremely small room then this is the place .
 The rooms were clean and the bed seemed that it is due for changing but other than that it was fine .
 The room itself is compact but there's enough space for a long weekend .
 The bathroom was a good size with an excellent shower and was spotlessly clean .
I suppose it was just about OK but given that I booked relatively late and it cost me <U+00A3>125 room only, I thought it was not worth the money .
 The bedrooms are very small and the breakfast is very ordinary although there is a good choice .
Our room was on the 7th floor and was extremely well organized and clean .
 The room was inmaculate clean .
 The phone in the room misdialed every time I used their speed dials   .
 Bathroom was smaller than U .
 Bathroom was small but this room was typical size of many London   hotel rooms .
 It is hardly intuitive and unless sometime tells you won't know what to do with the room key unless you've stayed in hotels that use this kind of system !
 Very small rooms I think our room on our last cruise was larger !
 We ended up taking the second room as we already wasted an hour dealing with it, and just wanted to get on with our day .
 The room was a good size, with comfortable beds, and the bathroom was larger than most london hotels with good shower gels and shampoo on hand !
 The rooms are tiny, which is not a problem if you are there for a short time, but anyone with claustrophobia should stay away .
 Hotel rooms are expensive in London so if you want something convenient, cheapish and near to a Tube this is ideal but be wary of the fact that this is a massive hotel and there will be queues for breakfast, check in, etc .
 Take a look at the breakfast room to see just how big an issue size is .
Staff were mostly ethnic origin, presenting a couple of communication problems at check in   room service was slow and fairly bland   and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises, again unusual for such a high profile company .
 I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro .
 We had a twin room on the 17th floor ,  it was a great room, with a great view .
 We had room service the night we arrived, and it was good quality, and arrived quickly .
 Breakfast in the Forum Room was good, although occasionally supplies   ran out on the buffet .
 The room was small, the beds were hard, but a great value for the price we paid .
 The bathroom was more than we expected for an English hotel .
 However, bathroom was so tiny it would have given a claustrophobic some problems !
 We got there very early, so no non, smoking rooms were available, but the luggage room was convenient .
 While the room is small what does one expect for less than $200 night in London ?
 it was a twin room and was barely big enough for one person .
 the bathroom was so small that it had a sliding door as there wasnt enough room to open a door .
 Room was clean, comfortable, modern .
 It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good .
 Our room on the third floor was too near the road and a little noisy .
 Room was pleasantly furnished and clean .
 The room was kept scrupulously clean and tidy by the cheerful staff .
 There was never any evidence that the maid did anything in our room other than shut off the heat each day, which was rather annoying   .
Our room was large in size and clean and well kept .
 My room was clean and well furnished, with a a comfortable 5ft bed .
 My only gripe about the room was that the hot water was not very hot .
 My room had the usual exec features of the bathrobe and slippers and as a Priority Club Platinum member, my gift was a half bottle of wine, which was just what was needed after a hard day .
The cold tap in the basin in my bathroom was smeared with toothpaste which went all over your hands when you turned the tap on .
 standards, but it had been recently refurbished   and the bathroom was quite nice .
 As the other comments point out, rooms are generally small, but the level of comfort is high as rooms are modern and rooms have been updated recently .
b basis Hotel huge ,  900 rooms Buffet breakfast good for a buffet This is a well run hotel with a great location for the metro  Rooms a bit on the small side but I would stay again
 My room was very clean and the tube was close by .
 The hotel was obviously newly refurbished and the room I got was very nice furnished .
 However, the room was not very large but one does not expect to get a large room in London .
 I found the pendant for the necklace lodged in a crack where it must have landed when the room was cleaned .
 This time however, My housekeeper constantly left dishes in my room that it was clear i was finished with   and neglected to replace the furnished glasses a few times .
 My room itself was a little worn and torn, , I was in a non, smoking room and my comforter had cigarette burns on it .
 They have a luggage room, which is great if you are arriving early or need to leave your luggage after checking out .
 The room was small but very clean and modern .
 Although the dining room was very busy it didnt seem like a cattle market .
 Our room was neat, clean and an adequate size .
 Standard room was VERY clean and seemed new or newly renovated .
 The room was small however, and space is tight for two people .
 The room was small but included all amenities .
 Room was a nice size,clean and modern .
the bathroom was clean and had a few ammenities .
 Executive room was clean and of a reasonable size, however the bathroom was one of the smallest I have ever seen .
 The room was also very roomy .
 The views from the higher rooms are just fantastic and the male desk person who checked me in was very nice and gave me a room on a high floor .
 These were minor issues, considering how great the room was .
Additionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .
 The unit in my room seemed to run endlessly and was quite noisy, particularly during the early morning hours .
 Yes, the room was smaller than we Americans are used to and expect, but was about average in size for European hotels .
 The room was very clean, and the beds were comfortable .
 I'll admit that it was a bit confusing at first to have to use the room key to turn on the lights and select a floor on the elevator, but it wasn't a big imposition ,  again it was just different from what Americans expect .
 We got in about 9am to the Holiday Inn, and the room wasn't ready yet   .
The room was adequately sized ,  there are only two of us, so we weren't looking for much .
 The bathroom is small, but well equipped .
 But I wouldn't splurge on the executive room ,  it isn't worth it !
 The room was normal size for a European hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have free wireless internet in the hotel lobby .
 Breakfast was included in the room and we utilized it each morning, as the hotel restaurant was adequate .
 You need your room key to active the elevator, which is a nice security touch, but the readers in one elevator in particular   were very sensitive and didn<U+0092>t always work .
 Your room key is also necessary to turn on the electricity, which some people here have complained about .
 The bathroom was spotless and clearly recently renovated .
 There are individual temperature controls in the room, which was great .
We stayed 5 nights in a room whose price was second lowest .
 Room size is fine and bathroom is good .
 and got the room right away even though the check in time is at 2 p .
 Three of us stayed in the executive room, it was a little bit crowded though but not as horrible as previous post declared .
 I think it is a good idea that you have to use your room card to get the elevator moving, it is just a security issue .
 On arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a very friendly valet who parked our car for us   and we were able to leave our luggage as we were early and the room was not ready .
 We made our way to the room and a real pain is the fact that every time you use the lift you have to put your key card in before the button will work .
 On opening the door to the room we had a real disappointment .
face it, London is very expensive, and rooms are not up to US standards  This hotel is PERFECT for the American that wants a clean, comfortable, reliable room without spending a fortune .
 When we stepped into the room it was an even greater relief, on the 17th floor we had a wonderful view of Earl<U+0092>s Court and some Georgian architecture, our favorite visual was an advertisement against smoking, in which there was a cigarette half un, wrapped with what appeared to be a fatty clogged artery inside .
   Our room smelled fresh and clean the beds were comfortable,  which is a lot coming from me as I have a spine condition .
 The bathroom was BRANDNEW and so clean that I even bathed in the tub, which ordinarily I would not do at a hotel .
 Room was cleaned with fresh towels etc upon our return later that afternoon .
 Room was small but perfectly kitted out ,  spotless with thoughtful facilities like retractable clothes line over the bath , mini, bar, hair, dryer etc .
 Breakfast was included in our room rate ,  and it was a great feast ,  lots of fresh fruit, interesting sausages, Japanese breakfast option ,  and the big dining room had a nice buzzy holiday feel to it .
 Our first room had an unbearable odor from an unflushed toilet which made me think,  Who else is using the room when guests are not using them .
  Of course we got a different room  , but why wasn't it cleaned before ?
 We found the hotel rooms to be very clean, especially the recently refurbished bathrooms .
 The room was fairly large by London standards, but storage space   was minimal .
 The bathroom was the smallest I've ever seen, but did include a full, size tub shower combination .
 The English breakfast besides having eggs, meat, mushrooms   baked beans also had better fruit than was generally available with the continental breakfast .
 The room was small by American standards but comfortably furnished, all new infact, a pull out sofa the size of a love seat and two twin beds .
 The bathroom was also new and beautifully tiled .
 Room 2519 is where the only ice machine and a microwave are located .
 We used room service one night and it was excellent .
 We then went to our room on the second floor and discovered a Queen bed .
 The standard room was somewhat cramped and there was mold under the rubber mat for the shower .
 We then went down to reception and had to provide a description of the contents of our room while the Manager on duty then inspected the room to ascertain that it was ours .
 The rooms were very clean and the bathroom was good for a London hotel .
 The room was large for a London hotel with a great bathroom ,  nice tub and great shower .
 We booked through priceline and got the room for $70 US per night which was a steal !
The room is quite large, very clean with beautiful view over London .
Well, upon checkin, I was told no room was available as  they had been full the night before  so I would have to wait .
 I had requested a room on a non smoking floor, but ended up having to take a room on a smoking floor that was on the end of a hall .
 What happened is the room was near where the maids came and went so you were always hearing thumps of doors opening and slamming, plus whoever occupied the room next to me was always coming and going well into the night .
 The in room bar was extremely expensive if used .
 We stayed in a triple room which was supposed to be the biggest they had .
 The room, although clean, was extremely small, for American standards .
 The room was big enough to hold one large size suitcase, and nothing more .
 The bathroom was so small that it had a sliding door, and not the regular swinging kind .
The room was above average in size by European standards .
 My wife adds the bathroom was very clean, with nice towels and hot water every day .
 The room is a tad small but is super clean and great location .
This is a 900 room hotel so can get busy at times in the lobby but the staff, standard of the rooms and other facilities are geared up to cater for this .
 The hotel itself is very clean and the rooms were comfortable, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the check in desk was always well staffed so it only took 2 minutes to check in and out .
 Got my room through Priceline   and was more than impressed .
 The rooms were consistent both times and on separate floors .
 The room was airconditioned and quiet  .
 The light in a bathroom would not turn on and we contacted the front desk and told them this .
 The room was very clean and efficiently laid out, although having to make due with the limited room in the refrigerator was kind of a bummer, we made the most of it !
 our air conditioner leakes in one room so they moved us right away which was very nice .
We expected the room to be small and it was .
 My family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this July and had outstanding customer service .
 I found the room size to be acceptable athough I was one person traveling alone .
 The room was very comfortable, very well, designed, and spotlessly clean .
 Room was small, but that's the case in Europe .
 Bathroom was nice with good shower .
 Continental breakfast was included in the price of our room package that we purchased through Northwest Airlines, but the breakfast room on the second floor was a bit of a feeding trough .
the rooms are really new and clean and the staff is so nice .
 The rooms are brand new with Scandinavian furnishings, and large by London standards .
 Bathrooms have tub showe combos, and the computerized climate control is great .
 Room rate including continental breakfast was very competitive .
 Firstly air conditioning in our room developed a fault during on evening but despite three calls to reception nobody appeared to take any action and the fault was finally cleared the following day .
 The room was very comfortable, clean, and rather roomy for European standards .
, We booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the aminities expected in a 5, star hotel !
 The hotel room was definitely as spacious and clean as all the hotels I've stayed in mainland Europe .
 I arrived at 1030am and my executive level room on the 5th floor was ready   .
 The bathroom was small, but the tub was deep   .
 This is a great hotel, nice rooms, not too big but this is not a problem .
 The bathroom was immaculate everytime we returned to the hotel and the water pressure in the shower is fabulous .
 The view from our 19th floor room was wonderful and included Big Ben and the London Eye  .
 We were not allowed into the room until 2pm ,  it seemed to be policy, regardless of whether or not our room was ready as all the other people in the check, in queue got the same message .
 Everything worked well, was in good condition and the room was quiet in spite of the hotel's busy location .
 However, the room   was extremely small .
 The room was thoroughly cleaned every day .
 When I arrived in my room with two small children the previous occupier had left unused medicine in the mini bar, this took until the following evening to get someone to remove this .
 Also when we booked the hotel we were told we would have a double bed and a single bed but at check in were told we had a fold down bed that when folded down stopped my daughter and myself from using the bathroom, the only way was to climb over the bed .
 The room was very comfortable although the cupboard space was very limited .
 Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !

" It's fast to acquire satellites .
 If you've ever had a  Brand X  GPS take you on some strange route that adds 20 minutes to your trip, has you turn the wrong way down a one way road, tell you to turn AFTER you've passed the street, frequently loses the satellite signal, or has old maps missing streets, you know how important this stuff is .
 The Garmin Nuvi 255W connects to satellites extremely fast, , So when I get in my car and turn it on, we're pretty much ready to go immediately .
It picks up the satellites quickly  , routes fast, has good animation maybe 6, 8 frames a second ?
 The revised chipset allows the GPS to make satellite connections quickly .
 The unit takes very quickly locks on to satellite signals, tracks very well and when you miss a turn or do something unexpected, recalculates a new route very quickly .
 Hotfix   to lock on to satellite signals works well .
 On I, 76 in PA, I travelled through a mile long tunnel and it tracked me perfectly even though it obviously could not get satellite signals inside the tunnel .
 Acquiring satellites is very fast though if you are moving while the acquisition is taking place it will take a little longer to acquire a satellite and of course on a overcast day you may experience difficulty acquiring a signal though understandable .
 I would say that 90% of the time it acquires a satellite within the first 2 minutes or less, the other 10% is due to the above events .
And it is very fast locating satellites, the new interface needs some time to get used to, it is very cool now you can drag the map with your fingers !
 It is quick in picking up satellite signals and very responsive with the user interface   .
Satellite lock, up and navigation precision was better for TomTom, e .
 I guess it was because during the traffic jams we encountered I guess it loss contact with the satellites due to interferrence by the tall buildings arroung .
 Can pay like $200 or something and get the service for life, HotFix which allows it to get satellites much faster when booting up this is a great feature and my only complaint about past Garmins that I used which was that it took too long to acquire satellites, this eliminates that problem .
by the time the main menu comes up after turning the device on it generally already has a full 100% signal from the satellites and it's ready to navigate, a beautiful crystal clear LCD widescreen, and tons of other features .
 Satellite acquisition time is very fast, as is re, routing .
 It also has a  hot fix  which finds satellites faster ,  which is very useful for starting your trip immediately and great for recalculating routes very quickly .
 SATELLITE RECEPTION, , Being in downtown Charlotte with skyscrapers surrounding me, the Nuvi maintained reception everywhere except a parking garage   .
 On a major highway leading into downtown it lost all satellite coverage and told me to make a U, turn on the 6 lane highway !
 If the  hot fix  satellite performance is supposed to be fast, I'd hate to see the older versions without it .
 I'd be at my destination before they located the satellites .
 It has no problems locating the satellites and does not get lost .
Improved super fast satellite acquisition
 I tested it again on a road trip and constantly lost satellite reception .
 When I first turned the unit on, it had to search for satellites and pinpoint my location .
 After turning the unit off and back on again, the GPS unit must search for satellites and  re, locate  me .
Time to search for satellites :
 The time that it takes to acqure the Satellites is about 10, 30 seconds .
It lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .
 The device beeps when satellite connection is lost but I never noticed any indication of when the connection came back .
 When you turn on the unit, initial satellite connection takes about 3 minutes .
I really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .
 The refreshing rate is fast and locks on to the satellites almost instantly .
 It doesn't take long to locate satellites, maybe 15 seconds or so .
 Good routing  , easy to use, quick to lock on to satellites .
 But unlike my previous Garmin, the satellite acquisition is very fast, and recalculation when I deviate from the stated route is almost immediate .
 Bottom line is I wanted a unit that is accurate and had reliable satellite connection .
I was able to connect to a satellite within about five minutes of taking the unit out of the box .
 I have noticed no problems with this unit's ability to detect satellites .
It takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but I just set it up as soon as I get in the car and by the time I'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .
When powered up initially it does a one, time search for satellites .
 I took the unit outside to do that, and it found the satellites very quickly .
 In the car, it locks onto the satellites extremely fast .
 It is much faster to find the satellite signals than my friend's TomTom 910 .
255W always acquires satellite signal quickly
 Didn't even have time to really read up on the gadget so there may be features I don't know about, but just have to link it up to the satellites and off you go .
 Many places in Northern Montana and especially Utah lost contact with satellite info .
The satellite fix is very fast, about twice as fast as my old one .
 large screen, text to speech street names, quick satellite fixes, and more, I think I made the best choice for my money .
 So far, what I like the most is how fast it acquires the satellites .
 Picked up satellites very quickly .
 Even when my pickup is in the garage overnight with no power to the unit when I back out the next day it has the satellites instantly .
 The 255W finds satellites faster than any other GPS on the market .
 It includes the new Hot Fit technology and remembers the satellites positions when you turn the GPS off, so the next time you turn it on, it can relocate them very fast .
 It also finds the satellite quickly .
 I plugged this into my van's lighter socket turned it on and it found the satellites in about 5 seconds while inside my garage .
 The recalculate time is excellent, so is the satellite signal connection .
 Took a few minutes for the unit to link up with the satellite, but once that was done, it was a breeze .
 Also, as a novice user, I am really surprised at the time it takes for it to capture satellite signals, holding it up to the sky, outdoors .
 My only complaints so far is that the gps loses satellite reception often and confuses itself .
 It's fast in aquiring satellites and fast in entering addresses with a minimum of keystrokes .
 It grabs satellites quickly and recalculates routes in seconds after I veer off in the wrong direction .
","satellite_garmin_nuvi_255W_gps","Acquiring satellites is very fast.
Recalculation time is excellent, as is the satellite signal connection.","Acquires satellites very quickly.
Recalculates routes very quickly.","Usually finds satellites very quickly.","Time for acquiring satellites is short and quick.

"  It is easy to read and when touching the screen it works great !
 and zoom out   buttons on the 255w to the same side of the screen which makes it a bit easier .
 On the 750 the zoom buttons are on opposite sides of the screen .
 The screen is easily readable in the sun, and I love how it automatically dims to 20% at night .
 Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .
The widescreen is a plus and I highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .
 The screen is very bright and easy to see with direct sunlight and at night time .
 If you are looking for a simple wide screen GPS the Nuvi 255W is the right choice .
One of my favorite features on the Garmin 255W is the odometer screen that will allow you to track all sorts of data about your long car trip .
 It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .
 Additionally, I find the data in the odometer screen to be fasscinating .
Another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .
,  255w has an arrow at the top of the screen that shows the direction of the next turn .
 To make things worse, in the the  Main st  may not be on the screen on the default scale .
 The way map is displayed is good and the wide screen helps to see more map area .
 Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .
The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .
 On the other hand, after about a week of using the Garmin, it seems to understand where we are, and now POIs as far as 25 miles away will show up when the screen is touched .
 The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .
I switched to the Nuvi 255W after the screen on my Nuvi 760 got cracked .
> Same screen size as the other 4 .
> Better screen touch sensitivity
> More responsive that my old 760  , plus a better looking screen
 The home screen shows four options :
 Any time you are viewing the map, you can zoom in or out by tapping the appropriate icon located on the top right of the screen .
 I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .
 If you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .
 So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .
 The screen is bright and the maps are generally good .
3 Love the touch screen technology
There were a few times I drove under overpasses on the interstate and no intersection was shown on the screen .
Typical of Garmin, the product works well, wide screen is very nice .
 Functionally the only slight problem is that on my unit I have to press pretty hard on the screen if I want to 'drag' the map .
 The extra features of the 255W over lesser models that I find highly beneficial include spoken street names and the wide screen display .
 Now the only screen I get says the system software is missing .
 I use the suction cup mount because I like to keep the screen in my frame of vision without turning my head, but I make sure to take it with me when I park my car .
 From the map screen it's but 2 presses on the large and accessible touchscreen to get a  Where Am I ?
 I also realize that even if I crashed differently I had been injured in other ways but the car were still drivable that it's but 1 press on the screen to get direction to the nearest emergency services   from that lovely screen that told me where I was .
I just wish the screen is larger .
1 Wanted a wide screen model, its difficult to see the 4 
4 It has built in picture viewer and a card slot, so insert your memory card, browse to picture browser and you don't need a PC, has enough big screen to enjoy
 Its for wide screen models and it fits perfectly my 255w with a flap that covers it screen .
 I chose a hard type of case that zippered the screen in, as I didn't want the possibility of it sliding out .
 Also, it's hard to view the screen when it's super sunny outside, but the text to speech capability is an advantage .
Before I get into the specifics of my review, let me offer one important piece of advice , ,  BUY A CARRYING CASE to protect the screen !
 These gadgets have sensitive touchscreen menus, and I think the fact that I didn't protect the screen on my last GPS is the reason it died after only 14 months .
 I had a Nuvi 205 and I really liked it but I wanted a bigger screen .
  It's an emergency location feature ,  you can tap the screen to get your latitude and longitude .
 BUT, in direct sunlight, the screen is difficult to see in my convertible .
Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .
The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .
 One thing that would be useful is putting a mute button on the screen available at all times .
 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .
 I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !
 I was afraid the screen on one of these things would be too small for me to see, and the last thing I need would be futzing around with a GPS screen when I'm on the road if I wanted to do that, I could drive and read a map !
 The screen is huge next to some of the units I saw .
 I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .
 It has a very clear and bright screen and is loaded with multiple useful features .
 It has a great screen presentation that is very easy to read when it is mounted on your windshield .
3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .
 The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .
 The screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .
 The wide screen and spoken street names are a must .
 If I'm listening to loud music, I won't be able to hear the exact words but I can hear it vaguely and that is a cue that I should glance down at the top of the screen and see what my next move is .
 There should be an external volume control on the unit, or at least volume control from the main map screen .
 The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .
 Also, push every icon on every screen you see .
 In both instances this could have been avoided if I had just paid attention to the screen which showed the correct road highlighted .
 The dashboard mount keeps the unit easily within reach so that you can safely touch the screen while driving .
 Was thinking about buying the 265WT for only $45 more, but decided I didn't need bluetooth or the Traffic Feature which gives you flash advertisements on the screen .
 Those are the only 2 differences between the 2 models and I'd rather not have flash advertisements coming up on my GPS screen at random .
3 Inch screen is awesome to look at both during the day and at night .
 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .
The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .
 The screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .
Sufficiently sensitive touch screen
 Now if Garmin would put a compass on the main screen always pointing to the north, it would be perfect .
 We love the spoken street names and the wide screen .
 The 255w does not have a convenient volume control  you must go through the menu system on the screen .
 The screen size makes it really easy to see without being a safety hazard .
The background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .
 The user must get into a few layers of the menu to access the touch screen volume control .
 Screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .
 I look at the direction line at the top bar of the screen to make sure I understand what the verbal instructions were .
3 inches large screen is large enough for you to see the details of the map yet not distracting you from driving .
3 inches screen and steady performance .
,  Its a touch screen and a 4 .
3 wide screen also   speak out the streets name and tells you when or how far to turn
,  Also very quick and I mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .
,  EASY to read day or night you can also adjust the screen brightness
 One down side is the lack of volume button on the unit you have to adjust the volume form the tool menu on the screen which can be a challenge if you want to change the volume when you are driving .
After lots of internet research, we settled on the Garmin 255W for the text, to, speech and wide screen features .
 When attached to the PC, the screen just indicates the connection .
 The wide screen is important because of the better keyboard   .
 We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .
 After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .
Looking at comparable units, this one seems to have more features and a larger screen .
 I can even see the screen without my reading glasses .
It speaks the street names if you touch the car on the screen it lets you know lat and long .
 Screen size is good and I didn't want one that had blue tooth and a lot of 'extras' I wouldn't use .
 With either unit, the text on the screen usually tells you what you need to know .
 I've only used the wide screen versions, so I can't compare, but I personally wouldn't want to go to a smaller screen .
The Garmin nuvi 255W I bought through Amazon has a dead red pixel which is always on and what is worse is that the position of that red dot is right in the middle of the screen .

2, inch screen   and a glossy, polished aluminum finish that one CNET editor described as looking like a Christmas tree ornament .
 Still, video fans should consider stepping up to a product with a larger screen, such as the Zune HD   or iPod Touch .
2, inch screen can now display up to 12 lines of menu text   and the Now Playing screen lists artist, album, and title information in three bolder, more readable lines at the top of the screen .
 Apple's iconic Click Wheel navigation can still be found on the front of the device, just below the curved glass screen .
 It looks great, is easy to handle, the screen is a good size and nice and clear, and the controls are very sensitive to the touch .
 And the 5th generation has a larger screen size than the previous models .
 I've owned all the iPod Nanos at one point and I can honestly say that I love the screen as it's good for causal viewing of a movie or show .
 However, it doesn't have the touch screen capability .
 It's really amazing just how big the screen is on such an incredibly thin device .
 The picture on the small screen is surprisingly clear and easy to view .
5G lies a more mature iPod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  The iPod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30GB version and $349 for the huge 80GB version   .
 New features like lager screen and radio is a major plus  .
 The screen and built in speaker  .
 The screen is easy to read and the built in speaker works well .
 The larger screen is a great plus .
 Don't waste your money on those 200 dollar itouches or the new version of the Zune that is touchscreen and isn't even as good as the 5th Generation Nano !

 what i also like is that it has a bigger screen than the regular ipod nano .
 I found a lovely cheapo case with screen protection on amazon, and I think the gift worked out great .
 the screen is bigger so i can watch movies .
 i love the camra, and the larger screen, and the radio  .
 good screen quality  Bought as a bday gift and they love it .
 i couldnt think of a single thing  this ipod is reallly great you can shoot videos listen to the radio plus you have 16 gigs of memory it is aweosme i really love it because its still as small as the last one only with a bigger screen and great color
 slim, size, vedio camera, screen clarity, photo playing mode  .
 What's more, even if I cut a long essay into chips with 5k binary limit for each one, some of them may still be unreadable through the note reader since the wheel just simply doesn't work out to scroll the screen down .
 Price, Size, Screen, FM Radio, Camera, Capacity, Scroll Wheel, Pedometer  .
 The battery is great and the screen as well .
 The larger screen is a plus for sure .
 Screen resolution is awesome .
 Lack of a belt clip accessory that also protects the screen .
 The only negative thing I would say is that I cannot find a sleeve coverwith a belt clip like I had for my 2nd gen, it was neoprene and protected the screen and thumb wheel .
 Easy to use video camera, Big screen, Fun color  .
 Also the screen I love how big it and, how easy you can read the playlist The color rocks !
 Screen does not scratch, but can get fingerprints easily .
 Very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  .
but I'm really disappointed they didn't keep the same finish as last year's matte finish, last year's model never got fingerprints, except on the screen itself, and looked new at all times .
 Nice size screen, good speakers for size, great new features, tons of colors to choose from, easy to use .
 Video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies .
 Watched one last night in bed while mrs was sleeping and screen is big enough .
 The old Nano stuff fits but no openings for camera lens & this screen a bit larger .
 New Features, Bigger Screen .
 Now all it needs is a camera that can take still pics, maybe a bigger screen, a built in antenna, and internet   Buy it if you're looking for a good iPod !
 Small size and Color, Gettin your Money's worth, nice screen, and video camera  .
 Same as last model with some differences in screen size a 2 .
 The mic and camera are great, speaker is great for video playback or bedtime movie watching, the screen is now even bigger and the device is the same size but Lighter than the 4th gen nano !
 If these get much smaller, though, I won't be able to read the screen .
 It's small and lightweight, it looks amazing, the video quality is way better than I ever imagined it would be, and the screen is huge .
 I like the fm radio, have an audio book and even downloaded a movie on it, , small screen but is watchable .
I bought the nano as a replacement for an older classic, which was a great unit but time has taken it's toll on the battery and screen .
This is a vast improvement on the last Nano, with a bigger screen and more capacity .
","screen_ipod_nano_8gb","Screen is flexible.
Big screen and nice improvement.","The screen is large and bright.
It is easy to read from the screen.","The new, larger screen is clear and bright.
The screen gets dirty easily.

" Keep in mind that once you get in a room full of light or step outdoors screen reflections could become annoying .
 I've used mine outside on a sunny day, and the screen is still very much legible .
 In fact it was much more detailed than the matte screen on my Dell D600 .
 Some ppl may prefer a higher resolution screen but I don't think it's required .
 I delayed ordering the computer because of the horror stories of bad batteries, faulty chargers and blue screen crashes .
1 inch screens, Windows XP operating systems, a plethora of USB ports, a card reader, WiFi and most have a few color choices .
1 inch screens are a bit cramped if several toolbars have been turned on .
 Some of the Asus special on screen controls, update and expand features built into the machine have not been all that useful and some border on being advertisements for buying Asus stuff .
 Two other things that make this a superior computer are battery life, and the LED backlighting for the screen .
 The ways the screen opens   enables a smaller footprint when the case is closed, although it limits how far back the screen will tilt .
 Surfing the net is a breeze, but I did have one  blue screen of death  when dealing with one demanding internet site .
 The light weight, the battery life, the keyboard, the non, protruding removable battery, the bright screen, the track pad disable button and general ease of use makes it hard to beat .
 I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .
 zoom in or zoom out of a screen  , but on occasion it will zoom when you don't want or expect it to because of an inadvertent gesture or touch by a thumb, etc .
 The occasional blue screen of death unfortunately has not gone away  Microsoft attributes it to an errant driver, but I have not been able to isolate what driver is the cause .
The screen is not as bright as my Acer .
 There are 2 bios updates and the latest is for a brighter screen setting .
 This makes the screen much brighter and as with all new computers it seems there are always important updates .
Also if you install Firefox web browser and push the f11 key the browser becomes full screen, helpful on a small screen .
 I got used to the glossy screens a while ago  this one is remarkably bright and vivid .
 Now I keep getting the  blue screen  serious errors .
 wrote  it has crashed unexpectedly and displayed the blue screen of death numerous times .
 Sometimes the blue screen of death appears for no discernible reason .
I began by considering netbooks with screens smaller than the now, standard 10 .
 If money is your leading consideration, then one of these may be for you, but for just a bit more money you get a much better screen, better battery life, bigger drive, more upgradeable, etc .
 But with screen brightness cranked up, bluetooth & wi, fi in constant use, some video playback  , and internet radio running, I'm getting a good 8
 With wi, fi off & the screen dimmed, I don't think I'll have a problem getting the stated 10 .
 The keyboard is not quite perfect, the screen doesn't tilt back as far as I'd like, slightly higher resolution in the screen would be nice a new model not yet available in the U .
 has an 11  screen with the same or better battery life, .
 It's small with a very clear screen .
 I've had the 1005HA, PU1X for a week now ,  on and running applications continuously ,  without a single crash, blue screen, or hangup .
 The touchpad feels great, the boot up was fast, keyboard feels comfortable, and the screen is good .
 My only complaint with it is that the screen doesn't go back far enough .
 The touchpad works well, the screen glossy, ness really doesn't bother me, and it's not too bad of a fingerprint magnet .
 On full screen display is smooth and no issues .
 Some iTunes content is a little laggy if it is maximized display, but not full screen for some reason, but switching to full screen display has taken care of that issue for me .
 And with a two, fingered gesture on the scratchpad, you can enlarge or shrink the screen .
 It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .
 On a full charge, with wireless on, screen brightness on medium, I get a reported 8 .
5 hours with no wireless, and screen brightness on minimum .
5 PASS ,  Screen is bright and large enough .
 Once I configured Firefox to always run full screen mode  , surfing was no problem with plenty of screen real estate .
 All features worked excellently for me so far especially appreciate the touchpad lock button  as well as the screen off function key .
heavy rearward weight bias so much that it wants to fall backwards  with the screen pushed back all the way
 the screen is STUNNING, and if you've got a bright light shining down on it, you've got a choice :
 you can either move the screen to eliminate the glare, or move the lamp .
 I'd far rather have this beautifully crisp screen and make the occasional adjustment for glare, than deal with a matte screen 24 7 .
One of the other complaints I'd come across is how for some, the screen doesn't tilt back far enough .
yeah, you'd probably want the screen to tilt far enough back to lay flat .
 And if you can't wait to twist yourself into some contortion in bed where you need the screen to go back further than reasonable, you can always invest in one of those $20 lap desks ,  you know, the kind with the beanbag bottom, so that you can shift the desk into whatever ridiculous position will suit your fancy .
and I could have gotten a matte screen, but neither of those  features  impressed me .
 Except for difficulties seeing the entire New York Times crossword puzzle all at once on the screen, the Asus satisfies my needs and seems about as fast as my 5, year, old IBM laptop .
 I was also nervous about the fact that occasionally the image on the computer screen  shivered , although it normally recovered from that .
 Also considered lower, end 14, 15  screens for use of the DVD .
 I like the gloss screen fine .
 The screen is too small for any meaningful work, but the apps DO work .
 Again, the screen is too small for this to be anything more than just satisfying from a purchase standpoint .
 like others have said, it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the glossy screen can be a bit of a problem in some lighting conditions .
I received my Asus 1005HA yesterday installed the two gb ram and tried to turn it on and the screen remained blank .
The screen is small, only 1024 x 600 .
I can hear the windows but my screen is totally blank .
 I can tell the backlight is on, but all I get is a black screen .
 I don't even see the bios screen on startup .
 The screen is sharp and bright .
 The screen is clear and easily viewed in indoor environments .
 With the view maximized, the screen is large enough to work on documents and read online research materials .
 The fashionable glossiness of both body and screen acquires fingerprints and smears rapidly .
 The shiny screen is reflective, which can be a problem if you have your back to a sunny window or work outdoors .
 I keep the screen brightness set at about half and easily get more than eight hours with wi, fi on .
 I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about as far as the screen brightness goes because my screen is far too bright at the higher end of the spectrum .
 It is a fingerprint magnet, and because of the glossy screen, its very reflective of light .
,  don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped
 Takes sometime to get use to the small screen .
 yeah, the new LED screen technology is that good .
The screen resolution isn't the highest you can get but I found that the higher resolution netbooks usually had older prcessors for some reason .
 I'm happy with the screen and resolution choices available .
 I usually run IE8 in full screen mode   with a 95% zoom setting and a 1024x600 resolution .
Surprisingly readable screen for the size .
 4 DO NOT GET WAX ON YOUR SCREEN .
 Hit F11 and you have full screen browsing ,  just move the cursor to the top of the screen for the controls .
The screen really is too small ,  1024x600 is barely livable .
With the battery in the back the computer has most of its weight in the back so the computer easily tips back when the screen is opened all the way up .
Screen brightness is very satisfactory .
 ASUS Docking is a program to have a quick menu on top of your screen to access all ASUS software .
The screen is easy to read in outside lighting conditions .
 My other HP laptop has a mat screen surface and is almost impossible to read outside .
 Long battery life, sharp looking machine, fingerprint magnet,glossy screen=glare,ease of use and portability .
 The most noticeable difference is the screen and keyboard functionality .
 The cover and screen are glossy and it has a 92% keyboard which is plenty comfortable .
 The battery life is excellent, with normal usage I can get about 7 hours easily, more if I turn off WIFI and turn down the screen brightness .
One of the downside I have noticed is that the netbook is heavy near the hinge because that's where the battery is located and if you want to put it on your lap while sitting, you have to put your hand on the bottom chassis so that the netbook doesn't tip over, and the screen doesn't bend all the way backwards which can be annoy, otherwise this is a really nice netbook .
 Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .
 I also needed Web connectivity for research, a screen with a low squint factor and a keyboard that wasn't too cramped .
The screen size works just fine for me .
 Having the touchpad feature of expanding zooming the presentation on the screen is a nice feature, but I have to admit having never needing to use it   .
 And it goes in that bag wrapped in the white paper plastic bag it was originally boxed up in, with another piece of packing plastic between the keyboard and the screen .
, I'm still getting used to the small screen .
Tiny screen compromises the experience of web surfing
 I'll see the first black screen, it appears to be starting, and then stays with either a grey or black screen .
3 sometimes the screen will all of a sudden distort and I have to re, start to get it to work .
 1 keyboard still floats  2the screen goes to a solid blue screen either right after starting or after it sits a while .
 Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
 Very nice, in fact, though I strongly dislike glossy screens ,  no matter, I knew it would have one when I ordered it .
The battery life has been very good, especially if you follow the rule of turning off the wireless and bluetooth, and turning down the screen brightness .
9  screens, but felt that was too much of a sacrifice .
 The screen is small but still large enough to read comfortably   .
0 out of 5 stars Bad LCD Screen, October 7, 2009
 I fired it up and out of the box it has a vertical red line on the LCD screen .
just a big dark, screen paperweight .
 The netbook is light and sturdy, and it the screen looks great .
 only 10, inch screen, small keyboard and no CD, ROM .
My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .
 Decent speed processor, nice screen quality, great asus softwares  , and very long battery life .
 pretty decent screen quality .
 although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .
One of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .
 10  can be enough for some, but it was kinda small for me, so the thing I did was try to max out the screens by removing unnecessary menus .
When using Internet explorer or Firefox, press F11 and the screen will enlarge, giving you some additional freedom and space .
 GLOSSY SCREENS ARE THE STUPIDEST INVENTION OF THIS MILLENIUM .
 Seeing reflections on the screen is just plain annoying .
 As new netbooks come out, look for the ones with matt screen and see if it has a good feature set and price .
 The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .
 With 1GB of RAM, it really isn't TOO bad to try to run Photoshop or something either  , but the screen would be too small for something like that anyhow .
The battery life is unbelievable, even while using USB to transfer files, watching movies and surfing the internet with screen brightness all the way up .
Factory settings to preserve battery life have the screen luminescence set to 50% but can easily be adjusted to the necessary ambience illumination you may need .
 The 1024x600 screen can be set, if you wish, so that it is a 1024x600 viewport to a larger 1024x768 desktop, reachable by moving the mouse to the screen edge .
 This is useful if you have an application that demands a 1024x768 screen .
 Screen appearance is enhanced by Asus software, and I do like the appearance and visibility in various lighting situations .
 The 10 inch screen started getting to me on the Asus 1005 .
I love the capability of making the screen bigger or smaller with the mouse pad .
 The mouse pad is very sensitive so I sometimes find myself on a different part of the screen if I accidentally touch something .
 The screen is comfortable and sufficently bright for occassional use .
 The screen is crisp and clear, and the unit runs great .
 The greatest shortcoming is the small screen resolution .
 Yes, screen is small, video card is weak, and keyboard is cramped, but this is the case for other netbooks at this price point .
 I have not done an actual test of the full battery life but from what iv seen in general use it has around 9 hours while running wifi and other applications with around half screen brightness .
 Streaming videos from Hulu and Netflix look incredible on this 10 inch screen .
The only minor issue that I have with 1005HA is that it does not allow the screen to rotate further .
 The screen rotation angle is good enough for putting the netbook on desktop .
 Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .
 The screen is very bright and sharp with a maximum resolution of 1024x600 .
 The 10, inch screen is bright and has good color, and the keyboard is only slightly smaller than a regular one .
 Performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .
 It boots up quickly, especially after getting rid of the extra asus software that auto, boots at startup, its battery life is phenomenal, the screen is clear and easy to read, the keyboard is comfortable to type on and feels natural .
 But even with that, and the glossy screen, fingerprint magnet, limited screen tilt, tinny speakers, and intermittent odd glitches, I still think it's a great value and would buy it again today if I were on the market for a netbook .
 Now the screen is cracked with big black blotches as well .
Blue screen crashed several times .
Hard to see full web pages on small screen, resolution inadequate .
 Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .
 The screen resolution can be a little small at times, but that is a sacrifice I was willing to make .
 Yes it does take some getting use to a smaller screen, the key board actually works better than my laptop though  .
I was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :
 Most of my professors teach from Power Points, and it makes my life so much simpler having the PPT on my screen that I can annotate while listening to the lecture .
 I have not accidentally knocked it over, but I think it could easily be done  the screen is glossy   .
 Purchased this machine to enjoy the convenience of Windows and the larger screen .
 years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .
 As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .
 The keyboard is great and the screen looks good .
 It's also a shame that this model comes with a glossy screen .
 I personally haven't had a problem with the screen, but it would be fairly unusable outdoors in the sun .
For this extra amount, I was looking for the larger screen, the longer battery life and the keyboard ergonomics .
 I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .
This machine is plenty fast, it's just that if I try to do work with it ,  my office's order entry system as displayed on the netbook screen must be scrolled up and down since it's a  chopped  1024 x 600 height screen, instead of the more usual 786 .
you lose those 186 pixels and even one line of a large order maintenance screen can require you to have to break the flow of productivity to scroll .
The small screen is probably the biggest drawback .
 Could be better and don't use the highest resolution unless you want all of your stuff to have the wrong aspect ration on the screen It flattens it to make more visible .
 Browsing is amazingly better by using full screen mode on browser with F11 .
 That extra space the menu and address bar take up are sorely needed on this small screen .
 In full screen browsing it is so much better that I would never go back .
 Because the screen is so small in order to get the standard 1024x 768 display without having to scroll the normal screen the screen has to be  smashed  so the display is slightly altered .
One hint ,  there's a setting that lets you  compress  the screen which makes everything smaller and allows you to fit more on the screen .
 I mostly find that when I make typos, it's not because of the keyboard, it's because of the smallness of the screen, , I just can't see what I'm doing as well as a laptop .
As others have noted, I wish the screen wasn't so reflective .
 And maybe it's something I need to figure out how to fix, but I don't like the aspect ratio of the screen either .
 Has all the features of my bigger laptop except a large screen .
1 inch screen is bigger than the 8 .
 I want a netbook for portability, not screen real estate .
, I was willing to downsize my screen size in favor of portability and speed .

 In fact, I love the car just wish Honda wouldn't have made such horrible seats .
 Body wasn't used to seats like if you bought a new mattress .
 The interior quality is OK, my 1999 Accord EX had a better comfort level on the seats .
I just purchased an Accord Sedan   with leather seats .
 Only needs to add drivers seat memory, 2, tone perforated leather, xenons, rear seat interior illumination mounted under front seats, and better tilt .
 I can also fit three car seats in the back which was the reason I was able to go back the the Honda family .
 The seats are very comfortable & supportive .
 I test drove an EX, L and felt the seats were too firm plus, the EX, L seemed too slow .
 This Accord has more road noise than I like and the seats tend to be hard, unlike my other Accords .
 Engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to Bose, Seats are hard and small for a large person .
 The seats are comfortable, and there is ample leg room in the front and rear .
 Most uncomfortable seats in any vehicle I have ever owned .
 Only 2 things could make it better  memory seats and a smoother shifting transmission .
 Seats are firm but not uncomfortable ,  very BMW like .
 Advise anyone considering the L to drive one for awhile if you can ,  some cannot stand the seats .
 The seat cover was coming out in between the seats .
 The only for sure complaint I have is the seats seems to hurt my back after I drove for a period of time, this may be because I am use to my silverado truck with leather bucket seats .
 DON'T rely on your test drive, the seats are Very uncomfortable and when the engine goes into the  econo  mode the vehicle  shifts rocks violently  forward and when leaving the  econo  mode it shifts rocks forward once again which means that the vehicle is  CONTINUOUSLY  SHAKING AND ROCKING .
 Seats are very comfortable and ride is very smooth !
 It's a black beauty with comfy leather seats .
 The front seats are extremely uncomfortable after anything more than 15 minutes of driving due to what I see as a design flaw, the seat curvature is too great, and even with the lumbar support all the way retracted, it still feels like there is some type of bar sticking out in the wrong part of my back   .
 However, long, distance comfort  is poor due to hard, narrow and deeply, bucketed seats combined with a very taut suspension which transmits even minor road imperfections through the whole vehicle .
 At first the seats seemed stiffer than I'd like, but after making a 2 1 2 hour trip, It felt very comfortable once I got the seat and lumbar adjusted to my liking .
 Great leg room in the back and the seats a very supportive .
 Door closure is solid, leather seats are very comfortable .
 Ride is very good, but seats are just a little firm .
 Seats are not very comfortable and not happy with the heated seats .
 The seats are very comfortable and I love the cloth .
 Seats are little on the hard side .
 The black leather seats feel a bit hot on the back in the warm weather but otherwise no complaints about the interior .
 Steering nice and tight, seats a little stiff but comfortable .
 We wanted three things, heated seats and mirrors and an easy to get out of back seat for some aging friends .
 Ride is superior, comfortable seats, radio excellent .
5 Seats= Like sitting on a church pew .
 Leather seats are the only thing of good quality .
 Problems with steering wheel, windows & seals, seats   .
 Smooth responsive acceleration,top of the line high quality supple comfy leather seats .
 Also, amazing leg space in front AND back seats ,  the Accord could almost be considered a full size sedan .
5L V6 scoots  sporty handling and acceleration good  sporty leather seats  highway gas mileage  appearance package worth having  no dealer service yet  Negatives :
 First off the new body style is very appealing and the new seats are more forgiving for larger men .
 The heated seats for me and my passenger are a plus for the cold weather .
 hard seats, hard ride, more road noise than expected, disappointing gas mileage .
 The seats are supportive and the materials are great .
 You get a V, 6, heated leather seats, XM, 18  rims .
 Cloth front seats big & comfortable .
 Seats are stiff but once adjusted seem to become more comfortable .
 The seats are very firm, but getting used to this .
The seats in my 2008 which is just like a 2009 are considerably less than I'm used to from Honda .
 The only hiccup I can report is that I think that the seats in our 2008 Odyssey are a bit more comfortable .
 Don't get me wrong, the Accord is a comfortable car, I am just a big guy and the seats just feel like they could use a little more of something .
 I have two herniated disks and the seats of the Honda have alleviated the pain in my legs and back when I drive .
 Additionally, the standard seats are not my favorite .
 Although it's a lower trim level, it has high quality interior trim  very comfortable seats  and and very smooth, quiet ride .
 Decent accel, huge back seat for my kids baby seats  large friends .
 we don't need moonroof, heated seats side mirrors we live in S .
 With the leather seats, comfort is close to EX, L's at a  best buy  price .
 Seats are a bit too firm for me .
 Leather seats are very comfortable .
 The inside and outside pads should ALWAYS wear evenly   Always had stiff ride and seats .
 I have a bad lower back, and the lumbar support on the seats is a life saver !
 Front seats much more comfortable .
 The satellite radio cuts out constantly, the heated seats are barely warm, the sound system is pathetic and the brakes wore out around 15,000 miles google it .
 We are both tall, 5'11'' and 6'2  and have no problems with the seats .
 After driving it for a few months I found the seats are tough on the lower back on long runs and it need a few more inches to go back .
 Seats are too firm and leather is quite  hard  in character and feel .
 I was slightly concerned about all the reviews with the seats being uncomfortable .
 I love the seats, they are supportive .
","seats_honda_accord_2008","The front seats are small, uncomfortable and not fully adjustable.
The back seats are large enough for three baby seats.","Seats have smooth and comfortable fabric.
However, seats can be uncomfortable after a long period of time.
Seats too firm.","The front seats can be very uncomfortable, especially for long drives.
They are too firm.","For those who like firm and hard seats, the 2008 Accord is comfortable.

Good leg space in front and back seats."
" Both of us having worked in tourism for over 14 years were very disappointed at the level of service provided by this gentleman .
 The service was good, very friendly staff and we loved the free wine reception each night .
 Also, thanks to Ken the concierge for recommending Grand Limo service .
 The restaurant is not cheap but is very well patronised and the service is very good as is the food .
 Service was spotty  Front desk was marginally helpful .
 This tuscan, themed hotel was charming, clean   comfortable and the complimentary concierge service was so helpful .
Phenominal Service, great room, great location ,  couldn't have asked for more .
 It has some charms in decor, and all staff gave very good service to us .
 The rooms were clean and updated, the beds were comfortable, and the bellman service was fast and efficient .
 A highlight of our visit was the historic boats at the Hyde Street Pier , ,  a national Park Service site that costs only $5 .
 The service was quick and gracious checking in and out .
Great location service and value !
So to sum up if your looking for somewhere to lay your head after a long day then this is the place for you if your looking for something a bit special with good customer service avoid this place like the plague
I did not take advantage of the concierge service, but I saw many people were receiving great service from them .
Great value and service for the price !
Excellent Service ,  Great Location
 The staff and service were exceptional .
The concierge can give discounts for booking city tours and for some restaurants, although we tried Neptune's which was recommended to us and felt it was overpriced for the service and quality .
 I personally appreciated the free internet service in the hotel .
In addition, they advertise Limousine service to the financial district but when I inquired they announce they had stopped the service and I would need to take mass transportation .
As I checked out I expressed my disappointment there were no biscottis and transportation service and the check out clerk tells me they do have the service and I needed to make an appointment .
 All employee's that I mentioned have shown customer service skills that are above and beyond .
We had a discussion on the plane that it was such a shame that customer service was gone in so many companies these days .
The rooms were a decent size for a city hotel and were very clean and well serviced .
Wonderful service friendly people
seems service just isn't the way it used to be .
i'am 40 years old and its very disheartening that people have lost their pride of service and doing a good job .
We have stayed at The Tuscan Inn on our last 3 trips to San Francisco, and I really can't fault the service .
 The staff at this hotel make you feel so welcome and its service with a smile .
 All the staff go the extra mile to assist in anyway they can and the staff of the ajoining Cafe Pescatore are just as welcoming, with great service and the food is excellent .
 We ate at the Italian restaraunt located in the hotel and the food and service was outstanding .
 Never experienced the room service .
 Service was all good, albeit a bit stoic .
 Unfortunately we didn't get to dine in the hotel restaurant, but I'd say it would be good, if the after hours service is anything to go by !
 I'd highly recommend the Tuscan Inn based on location, cheerfulness of staff, aesthetics in the room and general overall service .
Excellent service great location good value
The staff at the front desk could not have been more helpful and whilst we did not avail his services, the concierge always seemed to be busy with guests giving info and advice .
 There was also a gentleman offering massage at this time and we met a few people who had enjoyed his services .
 The food and service were both excellent .
 This was probably not the best pick for us as we don't like tourist areas and Fishermans Wharf if one big tourist service .
 There are many public transportation options including the cable cars, the trolley line and bus service .
 The highlight of this hotel for us was the service offered by the staff, particularly the two concierges on duty while we were there .
 Their service was of the level and knowledge I would expect at at 5, star hotel .
 One day we had the do not disturb sign on the door before the maid had come so we could rest, and when we finally stepped out for about an hour, we changed the sign for maid service and everything was perfect when we returned !
Amenities ,  While this hotel isn't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day   .
 At this point I asked to be put through to Best Western Customer Services and amazingly our room was changed to a king bed suite as per our reservation within the hour .
 They state that there is an obligatory service charge for tables of more than 6 .
 We dined as a party of 4 and were still hit with this and then the waitress failed to hand over $10 of change taking this as an additional service charge .
 We were very impressed with the service we received .
The concierge service is second to none .
Tuscan Inn has it all, exellant location,very close to public transport, very clean, impeccable, friendly service and a supermarket opposite .
We found a great breakfast place just around the corner in Taylor St, called Darren's Cafe, good prices with excellant food and service .
 Valet parking for $40 per night seems a bit steep,but at least the service was efficient and quick .
 very clean,well maintained,with efficient,if not overly friendly service .
The hotel makes a big thing of the coffee bisc service in the morning,and this is quite nice .
 I'd say that,as far as the evening   wine service is concerned,if you happen to be in the hotel,it's fine .
 Did not eat at the restaurant, but room service was great .
 Overall, the stay at The Tuscan Inn was great and would highly recommend due to the room service .
 There are other hotels in the area who do not offer room service .
The service in the hotel was really good .
 The restaurant in the hotel ,  Cafe Pescatore ,  does the breakfast run for room service, it was adequate but a little overpriced .
 Lunch and dinner room service is provided by North Beach Pizza, which deliveries many Italian specialties including pasta, entrees, salads, sandwiches and of course ,  pizza .
 However, there are countless restaurants of all sorts and price ranges within a 1, 4 block walk of this hotel, there is little reason to order room service .
 We did not use this service but thought it was nice that it was available if needed .
 We did not eat at the hotel restaurant, we chose to eat at the IHOP around the corner for breakfast and it was good food and service, and they are open 24 hours .
 Maid service was prompt and outstanding .
very good hotel ,  great location, concierge extremely helpful, decor is nice and the maid service was excellent   .
 The customer service was wonderful .
 The adjacent Cafe Pescatero was handy for breakfast but had some hiccups in service, but it was okay overall .
, provide service like high end hotels .
Will store your luggage in separate room on your check out day if you have late flight, want to spend more time,Oldest Italian restaurant in the country w in walking distance, back east service, integrity, etc .
 Split a fare w a private service i .
, we walked everywhere including up the hill to Coit Tower   then walked down just in time to attend 1300 service @ St .
 The staff was so friendly and helpful and the concierge service was very knowledgeable .
 A masseur was giving guests a massage at the same location, not sure if there was a charge involved for that service, as there was no information about that anywhere .
The hotel is conveniently located to the shopping centre across the road, and we made use of this to purchase our breakfast requirements, as we had not had great service from the adjoining cafe Pescatore for our evening meal and thought we would do our own thing each morning .
Housekeeping service was very inadequate, though .
and the service was just ok too .
 The whole trip was ruined by the guest service of the hotel .
 They say they pride themselves on being the best in guest service but I was not impressed at all .
The valet parking was overpriced, the service was terrible, and the coffe was cold .
service was extra good, very friendly and there is a great cafe across the street   which has the best breakfast in the world .
 The service was fine with the exception of check, in .
 From reading other reviews, it seems as though this hotel has significant lapses in service from time to time .
 Nevertheless, I did like this hotel,  the rooms, location, and most of the service and I would stay here again .
Nice place but service could be better
 Overall we had a nice stay but just had some minor service issues .
 When we finally found the church later, the service times she had given us were wrong, too .
 Speaking of parking, you're going to have to pay and it's going to have to be valet service, as there are no free self park lots that are part of the hotel .
 The hotel is pretty much as you'd expect from the chain , nice clean rooms well serviced, and the staff were extremely helpful,  very pleasant to deal with .
 Service was poor and they got our order wrong, but they did correct it at no extra cost and the food was good .
Great service and friendly Front Desk .
 The Concierge service is excellent .
 Valet parking was $36 a day, but we're not complaining because other SF wharf hotels have charged us a similar fee even without the valet service .
 This hotel is truly a value for the mid, level traveler looking for excellent accomodations and the HIGHEST LEVEL OF SERVICE ANYWHERE !
 But the maid service was excellent, it was very clean and the bed was comfortable .
 The service from every staff member we encountered was delightful .
Great location service and beer .
The hotel room was average although the service was good .
In accordance with the Tuscan Inn<U+0092>s Italian style theme a coffee tea biscotti service was open from 6am till 9am in the mornings .
 In the evenings from 5pm till 6pm a wine, beer and sparkling water service was available .
 Maid service was prompt, too .
 the service is poor, and for those used to staying in Kimpton hotels .
There is simply not the service, oriented feeling one is used to in this hotel group .
 It has everthing you need to have a great time in a great city,  location, good service, great food  , comfortable rooms and a complimentary happy hour .
 The cafe is comfortable and service was attentive and polite .
Room service at the hotel is limited :
 The rooms are small but very clean, charmingly decorated with a view of the little flowered courtyard, comfy beds, plenty of pillows   towels and smiling service .
 I really didn't get a chance to experience the staff's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom .
 One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE !
 The concierge, in turn, told us to see the bellman, who said the shuttle did not run on weekends and he knew nothing about how to arrange the service .
 We ate there several times and never had a bad meal or poor service .
 While we were making these arrangements, the valet secured a shuttle service to get us to the airport on time .
 Found the food there to be quite nice, and our service was always prompt and efficient .
I planned a weekend getaway and thought because of the location and Hotel chain we would receive good service .
 The service was excellent, the room was terrific, the bed was incredibly comfortable and the hotel is centrally located to all the major attractions of San Francisco .
Very clean room, great location, wonderful service and dog friendly .
 The personalized service always stands out and if we have a problem, it is immediately remedied .
 WORST BW we've ever stayed in as far as service goes .
 We ate breakfast there one day and were appalled at the slow service, rude waitstaff, and overpriced breakfast food .
 I had breakfast and dinner a few times at the restaurant joined to the hotel, Cafe Pescatore, and thought the food and the service were both very good .
 The rooms were great and the Service wonderful .
 The only complaint I have is the Valet service .
 The front desk is the worst service I have had in years .
 And the hotel restaurant food and service was   awful .
great rooms fantastic location and great service !
 i would also urge other vistors to prebook Alacatraz with Blue and Gold Fleet direct on there website before they arrive in San Fran as you can pick up your tickets at the self service machine without the miles of queues !
 The food at the &quot Cafe&quot  is quite &quot hotel, like&quot  but the service makes up for it .
 friendly service was evident each day and the gentleman conceirge was patient and helpful .
 The valet guy was extremely helpful and very friendly but the check in guest services staff on the whole uninterested and unhelpful .
 The hotel restaurant was a bit over priced but good service and good quality .
Courteous, responsive service and a great location !
 The service was good, the wine service each evening was very nice   next to the fireplace, and the location was awesome !
 The service was friendly and helpful at the front desk, but the conciege that I dealt with was not very good .
 Excellent staff and service and the adjoining Italian restaurant was superb .
 A very cheerful staff and prompt service .
 Great people, service was terrefic, especially during this stressful time !
 Teaming this Hotel with the great food   service @ Cafe Pescatore, I would definitely choose this hotel again while in SF, an experience we won't ever forget .
 I was also disappointed that the hotel's &quot room service&quot  came from a nearby pizzeria, but the hotel still charged a fee on each delivery .
 Being that I worked as a front desk person at a Best Western for quite awhile I was on the lookout for good service and facilities .
 We asked her how to get back to the airport without having to pay the shuttle service $15 each .
 And value is key for the rooms and the service !
 The service is always great and the rooms very clean .
nette Lage aber durchschnittlicher Service !

The room was quiet, clean, the bed and pillows were comfortable, and the service was adequate .
 There were no service issues to speak of, but it's not an overly, friendly hotel .
Good Location Horrible Service Disgusting Procedures .
If you're looking for a full, service experience, this is still not the hotel for you .
The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum is fine if you like large, impersonal hotels with mediocre service, overcrowded breakfast rooms and don't mind tired decor .
We found the front desk service unfriendly and indifferent .
Great stay friendly service great location .
 A prompt reply indicated not and that the reception area deposit boxes were temporarily out of service, so they offered to upgrade our rooms to executive rooms at no extra cost .
In London its often hard to find good location and good customer service in the same place ,  The Holiday Inn Kensington Forum did that for me and I couldn't ask for more .
 Breakfast was good, with many choices and excellent service .
 Service in all areas, at all levels was good .
 It's rated 4, stars, but I also stayed at an equivalently rated Marriott while in London, and a 3, star Holiday Inn Express in Scotland, and the service and rooms were much better at the other locations .
 Maid service was good and the staff were always pleasant .
 At the reception the service were exelent ,  altought during that five minutes I was standing there, the receptionists appologised three times !
Good Location New Room Bad Service  .
 The only cleanliness complaint is the cleaning service did not remove dirty glasses or a decaying lemon wedge with the in room kettle service .
 I am recommending the Forum despite the service problems .
Poor serviceNot friendly assistance .
 It is not 4 star hotel service .
Convenient location not 4, star room and services but OK .
ROOM and SERVICE ,  our room was obviously not one of the renovated ones .
Service was a joke , ,  the  evening concierge  doubled as the day doorman and was not very knowledgeable about anything , ,  honestly, the last thing I want to hear when I ask about cool pubs to go to is  why don't you go to the bar in the hotel ?
 Service impersonal but friendly .
 Did not use any of the hotels other services, but I was pleased overall and would stay here again .
 They also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .
 We arrived at 11 am, but were able to check in with the professional and service, minded staff right away .
 Someone needs to help those folks with a refresher course in customer service .
 Near a tube station that services three subway lines, for starters .
We are low maintenance so we didn't have to request service much, but when we did it was fine .
Not too happy with the service from frontdesk, concierge and housekeeping .
 I ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .
 If you need a hotel with services like access to a computer or a concierge who can do more than give directions and order full price tickets to events then don't stay here .
 However the hotel is very large and loses some personal service as a result ,  the service we received was variable, with little recognition of our Platinum Priority Club Rewards status, and slow room service   .
 For a little extra money, the soon to be Crowne Plaza over the road offers far better service yet with the same great location
 Only postive is their breakfast service .
Convenient location Great Concierge service .
 I would definitely stay here again for the location and the great customer service .
 Talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .
 The service was the worst service we have EVER recieved in my life the worst .
30am, service finished at 11am, there was a queue for the toasters and the cooked breakfast was uninspiring ,  the ingredients seemed poor quality .
Room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired Holiday Inn room service menu, when I ordered a <U+00A3>6 .
, but after I called room service it was promptly fixed .
There are no bottle openers or cork screws in the room so ask room service for them if you need them .
 There is also a laundry service at the hotel, but they also change an outrageous amount so unless you have an expense account I wouldn't plan on using it .
 Reception was busy but service was good throughout my stay .
 But there are much better hotels to choose from for the same price and at least you get some good service and respect from staff .
 The room and bathroom were very clean and serviced each day to a high standard .
 The main restaurant is on floor 1 and offers a full cooked and continental buffet was good choice and generally very good service .
If you're looking for a comfortable, clean hotel with a mid, range level of service and easy access, then this hotel would serve you well .
 We ate on evening once at the Garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .
 Did not use any other facilities or order room service .
 There was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .
Exceptionally poor ,  and surprising ,  service .
Great location service questionable .
 Our room was clean, though small, the service was great, and we would stay here again in a heartbeat !
I liked this hotel, Nice big room and very good customer service .
 Front, line staff members speak very poor English, and provide VERY poor customer service   .
 Poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .
 Room service took 15 minutes, which shocked me .
 We were very pleased with the room, and the staff was all very nice and helpful, including the concierge service .
 If you hang around in the lobby, you can hear other people complaining about poor service, poor room quality and a host of other problems to the staff .
but be prepared for some poor service quality .
 Service can be slow at peak times with waits up to one hour at times, but on average I had to wait no longer that around 30 minutes .
 The food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .
 The food is excellent and the service great .
Service was friendly, our room was on the highest floor  , but that wasn't a problem because of the lifts, and we had a great view of the city from the room .
 but after having spent an entire week in London, I came to realize that just about anybody in the service industry is just that .
 Service was impeccably English hotel, wide .
 The breakfast is self service on the first floor, not cheap   but not bad either as there is plenty of choice .
 The card which is left for you to leave comments and review your service went missing from my room on the fourth day which speaks volumes .
 The service is pleasant enough, and I was given a room with a nice view of central London   on the 14th floor without having to ask, despite booking on Priceline .
 This is suppose to be a full service hotle, but I would only classify it at best as a Motel 6 quality .
 Service at reception both for checking in or out can be slow and although I've always found the staff to be pleasant, not all of them fully understand english .
 The buffet breakfast is ok although not the best I've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' The food in the ground floor restaurant is good  I haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .
 On the first night of my stay, I tried to use room service .
 On the third night I tried room service again .
 Room service pesonnel called me up after about 45minutes asking if I really needed the stuff that I had ordered .
the atmosphere is such that they are always right and that a customer is doing them a service by staying at the hotel .
 Is this the level of customer service you want ?
On my last day I used the concierge service to arrange a cab for me .
If you use wake up call service .
 I think that is bad service .
 There is a shuttle service for 34 pounds which needs to be booked one day ahead and plys only every half hour .
Great location indifferent service .
I would stay here again because in London it really is a value for the service and quality of room .
 Despite its size, and the fact that there are over 20 floors of bedrooms, lift service was never slow, and the breakfast operation   is exceptionally well, managed .
 The maid service was good and everything was cleaned and tidied .
 We ate at a really good Indian, very popular, good service plenty to eat for about <U+00A3>7 each .
Basic clean lodging service lacking .
   The internet service which costs GBP15 per day is slower than dial, up  !
Good room poor service all round .
But those who put an emphasis on service quality should avoid this hotel .
 The rude and poor service started from the concierge who was curt when I asked a question .
 The service at the breakfast room was ok .
 The only down side was the same as last time, very impersonal service by the Management and the on, duty Manager was just pure rude, but if you don't have to talk to any staff members, this hotel is great .
Stayed in room 516 right at the end of the corridor was next to a services room from which there was a constant generator   fan noise .
 We passed a number of banks on the way up and also a large post office offering currency etc which should give better rates than the hotels in, house money changing service .
 There is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .
 In all, as with many Holiday Inns hotels worldwide, affordable with good rooms and customer service but there is always one or two issues that keep this chain from being a affordable and good place to stay .
 The fridge was self, service   and barely functional, so didn't chill the sodas I bought .
 The immediate area around the hotel is extremely well serviced by at least 3 internet cafes, grocery store next to tube station, as well as several nice cafes and restaurants .
 ASK is a very nice Italian restaurant nearby serving pastas and pizzas with excellent service which will run about 10
 If you are looking for a bit more comfort and better service, look elsewhere .
 Although we did get a strange phone call from room service at 1am, wrong number i think .
Well, located and good service .
 In spite of its size, we found the service to be good ,  speedy check, in, and very rapid response to a broken toilet at 11pm .
 Minimall with Boots pharmacy, Whole Foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .
 The hotel offers a laundry service which I needed to take advantage of .
 However the service was quite efficient  my pants were brought back the same day .
 It was clean and serviced promptly every day with fresh linen and towels .
com and their 'top secret hotels' service .
 Service was great and the concierge was very helpful .
Excellent location shame about the service !
When we wanted to watch a pay per view movie, was informed by reception there was a problem ,  it later transpired that we had been given an Aircrew room, where there is no mini, bar, pay per view movies turned off at reception, no menu's or room service available .
 Also we were later informed that only executive rooms had the service of mini bar !
 The maid service was excellent and we felt very happy with our choice .
We took a private car service from airport to hotel, and it cost 55 pounds .
Don't use the restaurant or room service, there's plenty of places to eat outside the hotel, there's a mini Tesco for groceries, a larger grocery store   plenty of internet cafe's, a Paul's Boulangerie right by the tube, great fro a quick breakfast, the Gloucester Road tube stop is a 3 minute walk, plenty of busses to High Street fabulous shopping !
 My daugher and I average about $70 a dinner regardless of whehter we ate out or did room service ,  ,  YIKES .
 Service is not particularly attentive, but not rude .
 Stunning food, amazing service .
Great service and perfect location !
 For the price, cleanliness, service and quality it definately deserves a higher star rating .
I wish that the hotel had better service, however .
 To get ice, you have to first get a bucket from room service .
 To get Room Service, it called Housekeeping .
For a similarly good location  , you can stay at the London Hilton Metropole for the same price and receive much better service .
 Quite snooty or surly service at reception, from two separate people .
Staff were mostly ethnic origin, presenting a couple of communication problems at check in   room service was slow and fairly bland   and we noticed a lack of acknowledgement by any staff as we walked around the premises, again unusual for such a high profile company .
 I stayed in room 354 ,  on the Exec Floor ,  no bathrobes, no newspaper delivery  , room service crockery standing outside room for almost 24 hours un movedand poor service in Bistro .
 We had room service the night we arrived, and it was good quality, and arrived quickly .
 Super dinner and attentive service .
 Food was OK, service very haphazard .
 It is very close to Gloucester Rd tube station, has plenty of restaurants, pubs, supermarkets, chemists within 100 yds, is close to Hyde park for a run walk in summer, near Kensington High street, rooms are always clean and have recently been refurbed, room service menu is better than other hotel chains, breakfast is good .
We had one evening meal in the ground floor restaurant, well cooked again, but the service was very slow .
 Finally, the hotel did nothing to inform us about a transit strike on the tube and when we heard about it on our own and asked the concierge for help with getting to the airport, he advised taking a cab service for 50 pounds plus banking holiday surcharge, , we luckily found a cheaper alternative by ourselves .
 The included breakfeast was a plus and I noticed the wifi folks using the free service in the lobby .
 I noticed on my last stay that the quality of service was very diminished .
 We were on the 20th floor   very happy with the rooms   the service .
 I can say that every time I have been disappointed with either the value, standards, cleanliness,service of the hotel .
 The food was good and the service was very good .
Excellent location and service .
 Concierge was very helpful  we didnt take the English breakfast but the downstairs bar offers croissants and Starbucks coffee and the service was very nice .
 Service was efficient but far from personal, how could it be when the place was as a large as it was !
 It met all my expectations ,  very clean room w pleasing modern decor, above average housekeeping services, accomodating staff .
Additionally, one other problem was that room service was very very inefficient ,  requesting a menu to be brought to the room took 45 minutes and the guy actually had the audacity to suggest he read it to me over the phone instead of sending one up, after I had to call three times .
 Room service will bring a bucket of ice any time, or there<U+0092>s a machine on the 25th floor .
 Typical London impersonal service from staff .
Excellent location service cleanliness and price at the Holiday Inn Kensington Forum .
 All in all great location ,  nice restaurants nearby, nicely pitched service .
What brings down my rating for the hotel is their service .
 I still can't figure out if it's a difference in  service  from US and UK standards or if it's just this hotel .
 Good concierge service ,  recommended very good restaurants ,  italian and indian ,  to us ,  in walking distance from the hotel .
 The hotel staff are very helpful and provided excellent service .
 We used room service one night and it was excellent .
 Food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .
 The service was great with lots of coffee and tea and toast brought to the table for you .
 The price is moderate for the service and the location .
 The price, the space, the location and the service were the exactly right thing we wanted .
This hotel is located in an excellent area of London and is just around the corner from Gloucester St tube station which has excellent service to all the tourist sites .
 Fantastic, professional, helpful staff, clean rooms, great room service, fitness area and Internet Business facilities keep me coming back .
 Great location, freshly renovated, very small rooms, anonymous hotel, acceptable service .
 because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near Starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to Kensington Palace, London Natural Science Museum, Harrods, Victoria Albert Musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .
 My family stayed in 2 connecting rooms this July and had outstanding customer service .
, We booked our room through an internet service and was lodged in an executive room that included all the aminities expected in a 5, star hotel !
 We also love the service of the staff, not to foreget the kindly people which store our bags .
I was very disappointed with the service from this huge hotel .
 Service was great and the location of the hotel was very convenient   .
 Be cautious of using the room services like the phone, mini bar and room service as the prices are sky high, but I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !
","service_holiday_inn_london","Service can be friendly, but is impersonal and highly mediocre.","Overall, the service was poor.
The staff was not extremely friendly and hard to communicate with.","Good service, sometimes slow and not very friendly.","Service was not the best.
Staff could be impersonal and unfriendly.",NA
" Mediocre room and service for a very extravagant price .
 The accomodations and support services are phenomenal .
 no robes in the rooms, ice machines are not on every floor  , no turn down service at night, and when housekeeping did come, they did not replace the shower gel we had used which was totally empty .
Concierge service was fine when we needed our boarding pass printed .
 Room service was expensive in the hotel .
 Even with the amount we saved on the room, we could not justify spending the amount they listed for room service .
Close to everything ,  underground eating, Michigan avenue shops ,  walking or short cabNegatives,  Room service expensive ,  ridiculously expensiveParking expensive ,  $52 per dayFitness center cost $15 per day
 I won't be staying here again until I hear that they have upgraded this service .
Fantastic view excellent service ,  top notch !
 The service truly was above and beyond .
 The Palm resturant in the hotel had some specials Sunday night, we ate there and the food service,etc were outstanding portions are large and we shared since we are not big eaters .
We found the service to be fine for our needs .
 We don't use the concierge services or any of the other services unless there is a problem .
 We had breakfast included with our hotel package and the buffet was very good and the service at Geneva was top notch, but I would never pay $26 for it .
Excellent service and Awesome view .
 We didnt use the parking or the gym or the pool and they have technology to remember the guests name when you call the concierge or the guest service they will address you by name .
While the Swissotel may not have the super high end service and ammenities   that some of the top tier hotels have, it is a very nice hotel that I would have no problems recommending to anyone .
 The fitness center has good equipment, and room service arrives even faster than they predict in their estimates .
 The internet service is reliable and fast, and the desk in the room is large .
 The Menu Prices for room service Forget it !
 I have in the past called Guest Services for the loan of a mini, fridge which was previously installed in the room with no problem  this time round, I was told there was a flat US$50 fee for this, irrespective of the duration of the stay .
 Also worth mentioning is that this can be quite a 'conference' destination which can make things very busy if you are staying during one of these events  service can be slow and erratic, and the wait for elevators can be long and frustrating !
 Some of the concierge staff were abit chilly at times, but the housekeeping service staff were extremely friendly and cheerful .
 Too bad on several days, they were not able to service the room until late afternoon .
 We ordered room service for breakfast and were not disappointed .
 My father and I were in town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .
 Overall, I think the Swissotel is a perfectly nice facility and I feel like we got a good deal but I would never consider paying full price to stay there as you can get the same amenities and service at lower rates elsewhere .
We were disappointed that the internet service was not free .
 The concierge and service line were both just okay .
 No greeting when you called them   and the service was fine but indifferent .
 Service was excellent   and housing came as soon as asked .
 $52 a night to park, read very carefully about the room service charges,swimming pool and internet charge in your room, and of course the mini bar .
 Guys won<U+0092>t care, women may feel a little ill at ease, but could certainly call room service .
Exceptional View and Fabulous Service .
 They have demonstrated a wonderful ability to deliver consistent service and go above and beyond .
 He got our heavy bags inside, showed us around the room, explained about room service, etc .
 There<U+0092>s a reason why it<U+0092>s not the Holiday Inn and I<U+0092>m assuming you stay there because of the amenities they offer and the service and location and views afforded and so no, you<U+0092>re not going to pay corner diner prices at an upscale hotel .
 Mom didn<U+0092>t want to walk too far at night, so after leaving Navy Pier   we came back to the room and I ordered room service for just the second time in my life .
 But the service just can<U+0092>t be beat .
 Ordering soup on room service will set you back around $20 
, with the tray charge, service charge and taxes making up the bulk of it .
 For the location and comfort of the new rooms, this is the perfect hotel, however come armed with your credit card as they appear to be funding the refurbishment through room service and mini bar charges, not to mention the room rates .
 We appreciated the elegant service and manner of the staff .
 rooms, service, location were top notch .
 The ideal location   coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .
Fabulous views  Amazing service !
 Great views, location, top notch service .
Great stay excellent housekeeping service .
 One thing that really impressed us was the excellent housekeeping service .
 Why is it that a $69 motel serves free breakfasts, turns on the TV when you push power on the remote and has free internet service .
 no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor .
 The person at the front desk said for room service to fill out the menu or go to the Palm restaurant and they would bill it to our room .
30 and they said we needed a voucher and mentioned nothing of room service, we did get the voucher and enjoyed a very good breakfast buffet in their 2nd restaurant, not the Palm like we were toldWhen we were checking out we asked why we got charged for the pool when it states the package comes with it and it says in their books in the room that its free .
 Not sure why hotels don't seem to understand that their guests opinion of the hotel is influenced more by housekeeping services than it is by how ornate the lobby decor is .
 Internet service worked fine with a $10 daily charge .
 Room service was extortionate though, very very expensive, so we didnt bother, as food outlets a few minutes walk away .
 We were overcharged by $27 on a couple club sandwiches and drinks we ordered from room service .
Nice location TERRIBLE service .
 The rooms are very nice , the location is excellent, but the service is Terrible !
 They had fantastic service there,  pricey, but so worth it .
 To use the gym or pool was a $15 a day charge, to print our boarding passes was a $6 dollar charge and internet service was a $9 a day charge .
The rooms were spotlessly clean and serviced each day .
 Bell Service was helpful in arranging a van cab to take us to the airport .
 Concierge service from our experience was good from one but bad from another so if you don't get good help the first time you ask, just go ask again later when someone else is there .
 Maid service, perfect no complaints .
 They had a great wine list, appetizers, and friendly service .
 We had a tiny hiccup at first, , our room wasn't getting very cool despite putting the thermostat to 60F so I contacted guest services and they sent an engineer straightaway while we were sightseeing for the day .
SERVICEEveryone was efficient, no big lines for check, in or check, out .
 Also, they charge exorbitant prices for mini, bar items and room service meals, so be prepared for that .
 Clean and comfortable with friendly service and a convenient Chicago location .
 A very recent survey mentioned that most high end hotels are no longer offering the service or will not in the near future .
front desk staff need customer service 101 .
 You can get better customer service elsewhere for much less .
 Service with a smile always !
 And to offer nothing to the woman who paid in advance and booked in advance, , , , , terrible customer service .
Beautiful view and bathroom, , , , terrible service and overall management .
 I had breakfast in the hotel restaurant and room service .
 Room service, however, was prompt and good .
 stayed at swissotel for 5 nights ,  just myself and two children   all the staff could not have been more welcoming, the room service was prompt and efficient and not overly expensive .
3 We had an Executive Room which granted us access to the 42nd floor Executive Lounge with day, round complimentary beverage service   and pastries, and free Internet Access .
4 The restaurant and bar service on the ground floor was OK, but during our stay, the lobby was always really full of other guests .
 The last remark in fact goes for the whole room, the cleaning service was perfect and the room recently renovated .
6 Make sure to sign up for the Club Swiss Gold bonus program before your stay for better front desk service and it will strengthen your chances of a free upgrade .
 The rooms were very clean, the service was polite and helpful, and it's near the heart of Chicago !
 We could not have been more pleased with the service, location, as well as the room and its view .
 On top of all of this, the concierge was so unhelpful and unknowledgeable that we called the W Hotel to use their services .
 In my eyes that is a step up from stealing because we did not utilize the mini bar, room service or the business center .
 The room was nice, but the service was horriable .
 Room service food quality was very good but with a $7 tray charge plus 20% service, I then absolutely refuse to tip for delivery .
 The staff was wonderful, our room was very comfortable with an amazing view of the Chicago River and Michigan Ave, Room service was superb   .
 I left the hotel for 4 hours in the afternoon with the do, not, disturb sign removed, but it was not serviced when I returned .
Overall, the hotel is a comfortable business hotel, but could stand to improve its service .
 Could have had a bit nicer service .
 I ended up ordering room service .
 Altogether a nice and modern business hotel with all kind of service, but nothing with individuality and charme .
 Room service was good and the staff extremely friendly .
 When you do find the ice, it is in a service area often cluttered with maid carts .
Service is excellent, the personnel strive to make you feel better .
 One very simple, but very appreciated touch was the water service in the front lobby .
 Overall, this hotel from top to bottom ,  service, furnishings, beds, appeal ,  is akin to a mediocre Holiday Inn .
 The furniture was a little worn but the hotel's service and location made up for it .
 We enjoyed the breakfast although the other evening food service was a bit skimpy .
 We hired a babysitter through a great nanny service .
the hotel was great, the service was wonderful and room service was quick .
 Room service got my breakfast order wrong but they made it up the next day when I ordered a kids meal and got enough food for three people .
Ordered breakfast through room service, which was great and on, time .
 The room service was a little expensive but very good .
Customer Service needs improvement .
 The hotel charges for internet service .
I send an email about the voucher to Swissotel customer service when I returned home and did not receive a response .
 The customer service stinks .
00 through an online hotel booking service .
 The bell service at the front door was nice, opening the door of the cab when we arrived and always saying hello when we were entering or leaving the hotel but the reception and concierge service was not as polite, often making us feel like we were troubling them for recommendations or when asking about buses and maps .
 They did give us an extra bed for our little girl after we requested it but having stayed in the hampton inn and suites, milwaukee the days before, i have to say the service was poorer .
com $200 per night but wish we had stayed with the hilton group for our stay in chicago s they seem to be more reasonably priced and more customer service based .
 Chicago is fantastic and i would recommend giordinos pizza  , we also did the chicago bus co tour, we paid fpr a 3 day pass which was worth the money because it is a hop on and off service and can be used to save your legs when you start to get tired .
 The room itself had worn carpets, some scratched furniture and leaky showerhead, butthe maid service was generally prompt and efficient .
 The rooms were comparable but I have to admit I loved the Fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk .
 Swissotel needs some training on customer service .
 we had to go up a floor and into a service area to find ice .
 The hotel is in a great location, the staff is friendly and very service, oriented .
Large rooms and excellent service .
 Got Swissotel for a very good price, but was a little anxious since some of the reviews on this site complained of slow elevator service, unhelpful staff, etc .
 The elevators were always quick and in service, and the views of Navy Pier as you walk off the elevators are spectacular .
 If you are interested in going to Navy Pier, there is a free trolley service on the side of the Hyatt hotel, you can catch, just make sure it has the yellow star on the trolley .
 I would recommend this hotel, they gave great service even though we booked with [, , ] .
 Service at the front desk was very friendly and efficient while room, service breakfasts were quite good and delivered promptly .
 We ordered room service for late night ice cream and fruit and also breakfast and it was prompt and very excellent food .
 Lots of folks were checking out and the elevator service was slow .
excellent Hotel fantastic service unforgettable experiance !
the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !
 A very nice, classic, comfortable, full, service hotel .
 The staff was absolutely excellent = full service, from front desk, to health club attendants, to business center personnel .
If without transport, the Swissotel is regularly serviced by the Continental Airport Express shuttle .
 You'll pay hotel prices for breakfast, but the price was on par or slightly below breakfasts that we've had via room service at other hotels .
 The lunches are reasonably priced and the service is great .
 Room service quality was great, but the prices were outrageous .
 It exhibits neither Swiss efficiency nor American service .
Valet service is a joke,  takes forever to get the car, and then they stand right next to you until you tip them .
 Everything was wonderful, including the staff and service .
 Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers .
 So, in all, I would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .
great breakfast great view and great service .
 I had also stayed at the Swissotel Boston several years ago and this was a much different experience from a service point of view .
 The internet access guest services movie selection didn't work either .
 I had a note slipped under my door early Friday morning telling me that they were working on the guest services movie thing and that they hoped to have it back working that night .
 Service was great as I was greeted immediately by bellstaff from my taxi and the desk person greeted me with a great smile .
 There was no evening turndown service or complimentary bottled water .
 Room service is limited after 10 p .
 The worst were the clorox, like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff .
Swissotel offered all the services extras I like , ,  lots of cabs, in, hotel bar, great views, room service, etc .
 I did not find the service staff to be above average in any way, with the exception of the lovely concierge .
 Honestly, I would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !
 We were very pleased with the hotel and with the service .
 The room had not been serviced and we were not pleased .
 There is no actual Spa, its just a service they make an appointment with and they come to the hotel, , so the services are overpriced .
 Room service was efficient, average priced, and decent food .
 I ordered room service late on Saturday night, and the gentlemen who brought it up was one of the most pleasant people I encountered in Chicago !
 Although my key card always malfunctioned   the service was top notch .
 We spent last weekend at the Swissotel and were delighted with the service, the views and the amenities .
 The maid who had provided turn, down service had also turned on the radio, so &quot Take Five&quot  accompanied the fireworks .
 Great views, bathrooms  , and room service .
 Never had a problem with any service personnel .
 The service we experienced was top notch and everyone was extremely pleasant .
 I ate their last night and the food and service were top noch .
I had a great experience here from the quality of the lobby, to the quality of the room, to the view, to the room service, to the food .
 Comfortable beds, friendly service, not as many noisy sirens !
 While the rooms are quite nice, I was dismayed by the snotty service I received at the Swissotel in Chicago .
 While our lakeview room was spectacular   I was very disappointed with the room and the service at this hotel .
 As for service issues, the concierge gave us erroneous info about the Navy Pier trolley  the maid failed to replace toiletries and towels, despite a $3 tip that had been left I normally tip $1, 2 per day and wait until the day we leave to tip the maid, but I decided to try something different this time since we were at a 4
 potential, but is probably in need of a renovation and some intense customer service training for its staff .
Breakfast perfect and service really good .
 Beautiful hotel with great service and location .
 This is a great hotel with no customer service focus .
 It amazes me that a hotel of this caliber does not understand customer service .
 Also, room service told me that I could not order scrambled eggs because it was after 11 AM .
 Very disappointing from a service perspective .
 The hotel is advertised to have multiple restaurants, but that was not the case either , ,  other than room service the only option for dinner is The Palms restaurant which is very overpriced for the quality of the food .
 Just don't ask anyone to provide you with outstanding service !
 Service was friendly and courteous .
 My family and I recently stayed in the Chicago hotel,   and I was so completely disappointed in both the room and the service that not only will I never stay in one of their facilities again, but I will certainly encourage all of my friends and family to do the same .
 We travel extensively and I can tell you that the scenario in Chicago could have been avoided had the manager taken any amount of time to use some form of customer service .
, followed shortly thereafter by a knock and a housekeeper telling us our sign wasn't out  the hotel's extremely limited cable service    our housekeeper didn't refill replace our shampoo or shower gel our entire stay, nor did she empty all of our trash bins at any one time  our room service on two occasions brought us cold soggy, , and very late, , food  the lobby bar closes at 9 p .
 I recommend this high class hotel with perfect service and will stay there again .
 Service was european and elegant .
 Great service, nice view, nice room .
 My husband and I had one of our most memorable hotel experiences at the Suisse due to the service .
 Just stayed for one night but did not receive the service one would expect from a 4 star hotel .
 Our last hotel stay downtown was at the Sofitel &amp  I felt the service and hotel were much better .
 Service was good ,  efficient and polite .
 This restaurant is within the hotel but seems to operate independantly so you cannot order room service from the Palm but you can get take out and then have plates utensils delivered from room srevice .
 By the way, all housekeeping and room service requests are handled promptly .
 Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service .
 I cannot comment on room services, however the staff in the front desk were professional and helpful .
 Exceptional rooms and service !
 Service was excellent and the suites were large and comfortable .
Beautiful Hotel ,  Service Slightly Lacking .
 Great service in there, and a nice quiet place to grab a drink and just talk .

" A few other things I'd like to point out is that you must push the micro, sized right angle end of the ac adapter until it snaps in place or the battery may not charge .
 The full size right shift key was enough for me to drop my 1000HE .
 You should understand that this is not a full featured laptop squeezed into a smaller and manageable size .
 The keyboards are 92% the size of those found on a standard computer and the machines run a little hot .
 The keyboard has a responsive feel and the larger keys   along with the oversize right shift key are a real plus .
 Yes, I did have an airplane trip in the last couple of days, and was thankful for the small size when the person in front of me reclined their seat back all the way for the whole flight .
 Taking the machine through airport security is so much easier than doing the same with a full size notebook or even the 700m .
 Battery life continues to hold up and the keyboard is a true godsend with its full size keys .
 I recommend minimizing the size of the scroll zones on the right and bottom, other wise you find the screen suddenly scrolling when you did not want it to do so .
 It's a huge improvement over my old, full, size laptop in many ways, and the few things that are less than ideal aren't such a big deal .
, Tiny and light the slightly smaller than standard keyboard is no problem for me to use, , and I'm a touch typist, , the keys themselves are a good size and feel good .
 The keyboard is terrific, solid feel and full size .
 It's the perfect size and weight to take almost anywhere .
 The machine has the most comfortable small keyboard I've ever used, because the keys are flat and so the surfaces that your fingerpads touch are actually about the size of standard keyboards .
 It won't give you all the functionality of a full, sized laptop, and the small screen may take some getting used to, but no regular laptop gives you this kind of battery life, and most of the functions absent here aren't used by most people most of the time anyway, so if the tradeoff is fewer features for greatly, increased battery life, I'll take the latter .
 Smaller size videos   play even smoother .
keyboard is actually a pleasure to use inspite of small size
 Size is one of the smaller for a 10  yet still maintaining reasonable useability .
 Ended up with this one based on smaller size, lighter weight and the overwhelming number of positive reviews .
Pro's ,  I so wanted to love the small size, long battery life, brilliant blue color and light weight .
 The performance is great for it's size ,  remember these are not designed to be speed demons but to be highly portable and cordless for extended periods of time .
I must remind buyer's these are not meant to be a replacement for a full size PC, they don't have CD DVD drives in them although you can get an external, which I have .
 Small, easy to grab and go, and can do your business in places that wouldn't open a full size laptop, easy to take notes on, or keep copies of what your working on from your main PC and continue working on it where ever you are .
 The keyboard isn't quite full sized of course, but very easy to get used to .
 I had some real problems trying to use my Toshiba Satellite when flying for the past few years, and the distance between the top of the display and the edge of the netbook when open is a practical size to get my work done on a flight .
 The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .
,  don't know why they use the screen size most do ,  1024 x 600 seems cramped
Everything I needed in a laptop without the heavy, bulky size .
The overall size seems right on target, small enough to easily travel, but large enough to be usable .
 Full sized laptops are so freaking bulky, heavy, and the battery wouldnt even make it though one of my evening classes .
Surprisingly readable screen for the size .
 Speaking of which, the keyboard's relatively large size ,  at 92% of the size of a normal one ,  writing longer texts on it is no problem .
 My only complaint is the small, compressed size of the UP and DOWN arrows, but I suppose that was probably unavoidable .
 Someone else suggested going to the store first to check out the size .
1 inches is a bit small, so make sure you check some 10 inch models out at Best Buy or Office Max to make sure you're ok with the size .
 It runs quietly and operates Windows efficiently, staying incredibly cool compared to the instant burn, your, lap sauna of my full, sized HP Pavillion .
 Speaking of typing, the keyboard is great, almost full size .
 Screen is nice, and adequately sized, , use fullscreen browsing .
 XP is great after a glacial Vista laptop, despite the Atom this is much faster than a full, size Vista laptop we have .
The screen size works just fine for me .
 It's 92% the size of a regular keyboard, and my somewhat larger, than, average male hands have adapted completely in a few weeks .
Some reviewers have complained about the physical size of the battery extrusion from the bottom of the netbook .
 Great battery life, decent sized screen, and the keyboard was large enough to be comfortable to type on .
 I originally bought the EEE to take with me whenever my laptop was too big to take somewhere, but have started exclusively using the EEE in place of my laptop because of its portability and battery life that greatly exceeds most full size laptops .
Light weight and small size ,  This was highly important during my travels .
 The ASUS is comfortable ,  the keyboard is normal sized, so I don't make any adjustment when typing .
 I needed this for a business trip because my full size laptop needs service .
 This netbook is great and I love its small compact size and ultra portability .
My advice is to visit a store to personally try the keyboard and screen size .
 although the screen is relatively small to my eyes   it wasn't really hard to get used to the size and the screen is clear and bright, no prob reading articles and writing essays .
One of the things that I found difficult to get used to is the size of the screen .
 Also tried a full size Logitech Trackman   and a little wired Logitech notebook mouse sucks like all mice but usable if a mouse is your idea of a good time .
 I'm using it with a Xion 2 fan pad that folds up to about the size of the closed netbook and runs off a USB port .
 The screen is very sharp and readable even with the tiny text at this size .
 And you can't beat the price with a stick compared to a full size laptop or desktop .
The small size makes it very easy to carry compared to a standard laptop, the long battery life is really great, and the speed and performance using various wi, fi connections was better than I expected it to be   .
The keyboard is excellent and even though only 92% the size of a full size keyboard, feels like the big one .
The overall size is just perfect for what I wanted .
 The keyboard is just the right size .
 The battery life is to die for ,  my full size laptop doesnt have 10
 Due to the size of netbooks and a wide screen format, the screen should have been designed to be able to rotate all the way back to inline with the keyboard .
I love the lightweight, small size of this product .
The power adapter is a nice small size
 It seems as though this is due to the small size of the unit, it doesn't have enough room to dissipate the heat .
just right for the size of my hands .
 Because of its size and ease of travel ,  pretty soon this became an important part of my wife's professional life and she was using it for work, business discussions, document development etc .
 I was never a fan of really large laptops or even standard sized ones as I like to stick to the definition of  portable,  so this fit's the bill .
 Like how they made keyboard as large as possible unlike Qosmio 17  which is almost same size .
 Instead I convert DVDs to DVIX AVI files using Fair Use Wizard and load them on to memory slot card and they play great, 700mb files look fine on this size of screen .
 It's 90% size keyboard doesn't take too long to get used to .
I was worried the screen size would be too small and uncomfortable to read, but it has been great for everything I run :
 I love the feel of typing on it, and have not had any issues transferring from a regular, sized keyboard to a smaller one .
 I was also worried that it's small size would equate to something delicate, but I am rough on my electronics, and the ASUS has handled a few rough tousles with textbooks in a bag slung into my car seat without any problems .
 years old, so the screen size was also a concern, but it is adequate for the type of things I use it for .
 As soon as you connect the VGA cable to an unknown projector and press the function key for projection, it automatically adjusts the size and resolution to fit the projector even if it cannot display properly on its own screen .
 But the projection was always perfect in full size and proper aspect ratio .
 I have more productivity  flow  on a conventional laptop with a full sized screen and keyboard .
 If I were looking to get work done quickly, I would pay the extra money to go full, sized, even if it's slower .
 The big one for me is its small size meaning that I can put it in the smaller pocket of the backpack and nobody would know that there was a laptop in there .
0 out of 5 stars PERFECT SIZE NETBOOK, September 23, 2009
This netbook is just the right size, great for travel and the 10 .
 His full sized laptop dies after about 2 hours of use .
 The keyboard is nearly full size and very comfortable to type on for hours .
9 I was used to, the increase in size and or weight was barely noticeable .
 Other than that, it is an amazing little computer and I can't see any reason to own a full sized laptop anymore .
, I was willing to downsize my screen size in favor of portability and speed .

 Sound, color, and features have made this a good Xmas purchase .
 sound quality with no headphones in  This is my first iPod and I'm very happy to have made the switch from a different MP3 brand .
 My only real complaint is that if you listen to the iPod without the headphones in   the sound gets a little off .
 They have added a lot of great features and it still has the same great sound and ease of use .
 Earphones sound good, but slides out of ears .
 The earphones sound good, but slides out of your ears and have to be pushed back in to get the full sound effect .
 Easy to use, good value for money, great sound quality  .
  I gave the duribility and sound quality low scores so that the overall rating would be low .
 I am sure that if the thing worked it would have sounded great .
 It is very easy to set up and use plus has great sound .

 EASY, FUN, SOUND QUALITY, SMALL  .
 I can't compare to any others, but the sound quality is really good .
 Doesn't sound too good, but it's nice to have if you need to listen to something right away !
 Only things I wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature .
 The gym music drowns out the sound .
 I love the sound quality of the earbuds, but they fit horribly in my ears .
 Very easy to use, love the pedometer, lightweight, thin, nice screen, great sound, battery lasts much longer than stated  .
 Easy to use, Great sound, long battery life, love the fact that I can tune in to my favorite radio station, and I'm into exercise so the pedometer with calories burned is a great addition .
 The Headphone Jack is bad out of the box, sound crackles with the lightest touch of the headphone jack which makes the radio useless because they use the headphone cable as the antenna .
 Turn the volume up and the sound in the headphone lowers, turn the volume down and the sound goes up .
 Video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies .
 the sound quality is very good .
 i was surprised, b c thats one of the downsides i found through time from other customers, but im happy with the quality of sound, i also think adding noise cancel, ear buds phones would greatly improve the sound .

"Another feature on the 255w is a display of the posted speed limit on the road which you are currently on right above your current displayed speed .
 I found myself not even looking at my car speedometer as I could easily see my current speed and the speed limit of my route at a glance .
My final decision was to keep the 255w and return the 750 because I really liked the graphic turn indicator and the posted speed limit and current speed indicators .
 It even tells you the speed limit on most roads .
 The new display posts speed limit signs of major roads flush left on the screen, which is a new feature that is also really helpful, if you're driving in an unfamiliar area .
 Display is excellent ,  the layout of information on the screen is very good showing upcoming turns at the top, your speed, the local speed limit and the estimated time of arrival at the bottom .
 But the name of the game for thieves is speed .
 With a reset button, you can track your max speed, moving time, stopped time, average speed total for the trip, average moving speed, etc .
 It tells you on the main screen your estimated time of arrival which will change depending upon your stops and speed .
 Well, you can one up him now by not only announcing the time, but the average speed as well, and you have documented proof of the reason you were delayed for precisely 7 .
,  Speed of map updates is awesome .
 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .
 TomTom seems to underestimate speed limits on community highways and gives sub, optimal routes .
 For example, on the route from Rocky Mountain National park to Arches National Park Garmin's route is 40 mins shorter on a 7 hour drive because it chooses shorter route along minor highways instead of longer route along I, 70 with higher speed limit .
 If you are driving in NYC or other major city, be prepared to add 1 minute for each red traffic light and beware that Garmin expects you to drive with a speed close to speed limit along NYC streets .
,  255w shows speed limit on most highways and some streets .
 That newer interface, as another reviewer has mentioned, gives you speed limits on some major roads, shows you your current speed, puts the zoom buttons closer together, changes text size to give you road names, and shows you the direction of the next upcoming turn near the distance to the turn .
 SPEED, , on most major highways, it tells what the speed limit is for that road   AND tells you what your speed is .
Indicates posted speed limits of the road you are on
 On the lower left hand side, this unit shows the maximum speed limit for the road you are traveling .
 This is very useful feature because many a times this will help to avoid the risk of getting a speeding ticket .
 By the way, the bottom menu also shows your current driving speed .
 That's what the car's speedometer is for .
 And, it's nice that the Garmin tells you that, at your current speed, you'll reach your destination in 43 minutes .
 When you are looking at the map, you are shown the speed limit for the road you are travelling on, and your actual speed .
 I have noticed that when I see a speed limit sign on the road, indicating a change of speed limit for that road, the Nuvi is not far behind in changing the speed limit on the screen .
 I can see that this could at some point become out of date if the governing authority changes the speed limit on a particular road, but it is a cool function nonetheless .
 It was fun to know where you are and the speed that you are going and the time you will be there .
6 Love the speed limit and actual speed indicators .
 I have observed several cases on an interstate where the 255W required driving well over the speed limit in order to achieve the initial arrival estimate .
 The city routes were somewhat closer but they could not have actually been faster because of the numerous traffic lights and slower driving speed .
I really love the new interface, the turn signs at the corner, speed limit indicator and the fast satellite reception .
 It has a lot of good features ,  including a speedometer, posted speed limits on major roads, and it notes your average and max speed on your current trip .
, alerting you that a rest stop is coming up in a mile, or speed alerts .
 Lastly  , you can immediately see the speed limit for every road you are on .
The local  speed limit  is shown on left side of the screen with current driving speed shown at the bottom of the screen .
 I also enjoy the estimated time of arrival feature that recalibrates itself automatically based on your travel speed .
 Having the speed limit show up on the screen was also great since I was in unfamiliar territory .
 I watched the screen several times as I passed by a speed limit sign, and it would change almost immediately as I passed by !
 I used it the day I bought it,   and then this morning, and as soon as it comes on it is  ready to navigate  The only downfall of this product, and the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the fact that the speed limit it displays for the road you are on isn't 100% accurate .
 The road I live off of, the speed limit is 45, the GPS says that the speed limit is 50 .
 From what I have seen as far as the speed limit issue is that it is off only by 5mph, but dead on in other places .
,  The speed limit sign on the display is handy but in the first week of using the GPS I found it had the wrong speed limit a couple times .
 The only glitch I have found so far is that the speed limits are not 100% accurate, although the GPS, amazingly, is able to very accurately tell you how fast your vehicle is moving .
 I was a little disappointed in the inaccuracy of the posted speed limit, as I'm guilty of not paying close enough attention to those signs, especially w  interstate speed traps that are constantly changing up and down .
 I also really like the way it shows my speed and the posted speed limit .
 The posted speed limit on the screen is pretty cool too .
 In the week that I have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed I am traveling .
Shows the speed limits on the major roads !
The turn or exit instructions happen too close to the turns or exits when at highway speeds .
 There should be some features built, in the device such as speed limit monitor .
 This greatly helps the driver to keep his eye on the road instead of looking at the speedometer from time to time .
 Some countries impose lower speed limit in residential areas .
One unexpected feature is the speed limit and actual speed displayed on the map .
 The speed limit is usually correct except on recently modified highways .
 I often find myself wondering if the speed limit changed and I didn't see the sign, so for this one feature I leave the unit on even if it is not navigating to a set location .
 If it helps me avoid one speeding ticket it will have paid for itself .
 I liked the way it tells you the speed limit and how fast you are going .
 It knows exactly what the speed limit is on all major routes .
 It is cool to always know what the speed limit is and exactly how fast you are traveling   .
,  Tells you the streets speed limit
 It is very easy to use, and when driving in the US  , it displays the speed limit and your speed, which is helpful when converting from Kms to Miles .
LOCAL SPEED LIMIT SOMETIMES WERE NOT CORRECT,THEN WE WOULD PASS A SPEED LIMIT SIGN & IT WOULD CORRECT ITSELF .
SHOWING ACTUAL SPEED IS NICE ,  ESPECIALLY FOR THE LITTLE WOMEN, AS SHE LOVES TO REMIND ME ALONG THE WAY .
Plus you can download speed cameras alerts at http :
 I can't believe how accurate and detailed the information estimated time of arrival,speed limits along the way,and detailed map of my route, to name a few .
 What I like most about the 255W is that it shows the road's speed limit right above your actual speed, which I find most helpful, since, again, I use it mostly in areas where I'm not familiar with the roads and local speed limits .
 The new speed limit display on the 205 255 is quite helpful .
 Speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch .

 XP SP3 Performance Comparison , smaller resource footprint, and faster start shutdown wake times .
Other than that, it starts up pretty fast .
 Its faster to load, easier to use, and it has a new feature called the library where you can access all your related files in one window .
 Performance wise it is slightly faster than Vista and I'm talking 10 to 15 seconds difference for starting the computer, other computers I have the run on Linux still start in less than 1 quarter the time that Windows 7 does .
 If you have newer hardware, 64, bit is probably the way to go as it is faster and will allow you to take advantage of more than 3 .
 Installation took about 30 minutes, actually much faster than any other OS install I've ever done .
 Overall the OS just 'feels' faster, snappier, and easier to use .
 If you want a stable, fast, visually appealing and advances OS, W7 will not disappoint .
 It does boot up faster than Vista, I do like the taskbar at the bottom as you can  pin  icons to start all of your programs and you can start a program with the desired file opening .
Although Win 7 seems a bit faster than Vista did, I do not notice any decrease in the start, up time .
It may be that Win7 is faster, sounder, prettier, etc .

 My system seems to be faster, all of my previous programs and peripherals run without a problem, things come up quicker when clicking on them and I love the new look .
 How about allowing the user to keep the menu open so thathe she doesn't have to repeatedly click to open it if there's a failure or the connection is to slow ?
1 Very fast SDHC scanning speed in comparison to vista and xp  big headache relief .
 It might do that on vista   but I got the trojans recently and haven't been using vista as much since it's on a slow HP mini netbook that gets sickeningly hot to the touch .
5 Seems to load the desktop much faster than vista, but it might be because I have 2 gigs of ram on my w7 netbook and only 1 on my vista one .
This is much faster than visata and I love it .
Some of the things I like most about Windows 7 is how fast it boots up and shuts off .
 When I ran Vista, it was a bit slower .
 But Windows 7 is definitely faster !
 It is also way faster than what I experience using Windows XP, but I won't get into that .
It is more stable than Vista and wakes up from sleep much faster, also boots faster .
It boots faster and shuts down faster than XP .
XP Mode worked on everything I had except an Honestech analog video capture device, but seemed to be slower .
 I like many other people, was running Vista and tired of it being so slow and crashing .
 As far as speed, I will admit that its not as fast as XP .
 The speed at which the upgrade completed is quite fast and the driver hardware detection was seamless .
 The machines run as fast as ever with new functionality and better stability   .
 fast, stable, compatible, and cool .
It is as fast as Vista if not faster .
 It's very stable, it seems significantly faster than Vista, and it has got rid of most of the redundant security conformation dialogs .
 Programs load and run faster than ever .
 Windows 7 is also faster in the core of the operating system .
 The operating system loads faster, shuts off faster and so far has need a  3 finger salute ,  control alt delete  about as often as Vista .
 I do note this computer is running much faster but part of that may well be that it now has 4 gb of memory as opposed to 3gb
 All the applications that I checked worked OK, although Photoshop opened slowly .
 Several improvements, and it does seem faster .
 , RW   | Creative Sound Blaster Audigy 4 | MOTU FastLane USB MIDI interface | E, MU 0404 USB audio interface | Yamaha YST, M15 speakers | HP Photosmart 8150 printer | HP Scanjet 4070 scanner | D, Link DIR, 628 router | Microsoft Natural Keyboard & Optical Mouse | Logitech RumblePad 2 | Windows 7 Home Premium x64
Also it starts faster and runs things faster .
34 seconds faster will make a HUGE difference .
I installed the 64bit version and it made my computer respond a lot faster .
 I can finally use adobe CS4, before with Vista 32bit photoshop cs4 wouldn't run so smoothly as cs3 but now it opens faster and is just working great .
 I ordered the upgrade disc from HP and tried 3 times to upgrade to Vista, but all 3 times I had problems with it being too slow, buggy, and my software games printer didn't work .
 It's as fast as XP, and all my software and hardware work great !
 It's a faster install, and you get a fresh clean install so it feels like a new computer   .
 My system boots much faster, and shuts down almost instantly now .
it's fast, very organized and just plain and simple witty .
 Also connect time is way faster .
 Finding and configuring is way more intuitive, start up and shut down is faster, and best of all, that damn hard drive light is not always on .
 I have been running Win7 for a week now and and it is at least twice as fast as Win2K   .
 I have to say it was the smoothest, fastest, and easiest install since doing a DOS install .
 Applications are noticeably faster ,  especially Quicken 09, Outlook 07 .
 It boots faster, the programs run faster and the overall performance has been nothing short of amazing .
 Vista had all of its upgrades and worked fine, but did not connect to the internet as fast .
 It operates much faster, starts up faster, and rarily freezes up like the worthless Vista .
 W7 does everything so much faster also .

 Obviously compared to XP you know it will be slower going in but I am very happy with the operating system .
 It's fast, it doesn't crash, and the interface is clean and far more Mac, like than any previous OS from M$ .
 I own XP Professional and wanted a nice, clean install of Win7 so I didn't have a bunch of legacy files hanging around to slow down Win7 so I reformatted the HD before doing the Win7 install .
 It is very fast and very user friendly .
Although most are saying that the start up is faster  I happen to disagree, I feel its about the same .
 It takes a little work to setup and doesn't run you application as fast as they would natively .
 You need a faster CPU and extra memory if you plan on using this a lot .
I am very happy with the program, it is much faster, I upgraded from Windows xp, the bad part is there is no driver available to install for my HP wireless printer to work .

 Despite that we enjoyed our mini trip and loved the staff .
 The bed was comfortable  the room was clean  the view was fantastic  and the staff was both helpful and friendly .
The staff is friendly enough and check in, check out went smoothly without incident .
 The front desk staff was not mean, but not very informative either .
 Some of the concierge staff were abit chilly at times, but the housekeeping service staff were extremely friendly and cheerful .
 The hotel was a bit busy during this weekend, but the staff did a great job of helping me with whatever I needed .
My only criticism would be that perhaps due to the size of the building and it was busy that staff appeared a bit impersonal .
 The Hotel staff were professional, but the fornt desk was somewhat slow at check in .
 My father and I were in town for four days from Los Angeles to catch a game at Wrigley Stadium, and the front desk and bar staff were all very friendly and accommodating, providing recommendations to us about the attractions, and transportation services .
 Instead we were offered a rude and incompetant staff, amateur and slow valet, over, priced internet, garage and fitness room access charges and an inept business office .
 Room 1619 was a very nice room, had a great view, beds were soft and very nice to sleep in, TV was very nice, show was very nice, staff was awesome saw to every need I inquired about .
STAFFHas that midwestern charm .
 The staff is quite accommodating .
I was very impressed with this hotel and its staff .
 The rooms were great, the staff was excellent .
 Very close to everything, or the front staff will hail a cab for you .
 You come to a place like Trip Advisor and it<U+0092>s so, so hard to tell fact from fiction or even to tell whether or not someone was having a bad day when they arrived or left or whether or not a guest was rude him herself and thus caused the hotel staff to be standoffish or what .
 While we were there I would have to say I saw one or two people guests who were less than polite to the hotel staff .
 If you walk in feeling entitled with your nose up in the air like they owe you something, then I daresay you might find something to squawk about, but the hotel staff I encountered doesn<U+0092>t sound anything like the staff some reviewers have mentioned .
Thanks to the management and staff for our fabulous weekend .
 The hotel was beautiful, clean, and the staff was wonderful .
 Some nice extras and the staff was very professional and most helpful .
 I compliment the hotel staff on their professionalism, their friendliness and their attention to detail .
 The concierge   staff was helpful and steered us in the direction of a great restaurant we could walk to .
 The several staff folks with whom I interacted were all lovely, including day &amp  night front desk, concierge, doorman, bartenders and restaurant servers .
 We appreciated the elegant service and manner of the staff .
 Where other hotel staff have sometimes acted &quot put out&quot  for being asked to board our luggage after checkout while we amused ourselves until flight time, Swissotel staff were charming and kind about taking it off our hands .
 The staff is always cheerful and helpful upon arrival and during my stay .
 The staff is more than accomadating and will take care of any need you might have .

 We found plenty a nice restaurants that were recomended by the &quot natives&quot  as they call themselves rather than hotel staff .
 The hotel staff tend to be aware of the tourist traps since they are close by .
Great Facility and Location ,  So, So Staff .
My one issue was with the staff .
 The front desk staff were friendly and relatively efficient but utterly lacked any warmth   .
 Staff was very accomodating .
 I always tip housekeeping and the staff never disappointed .
front desk staff need customer service 101 .
The front desk staff was never very helpful when we had any requests for simple things .
 Why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?
 If you dont mind the attitude of dealing with a rude staff, go for it .
 Overall would stay elsewhrere downtown to many other properties who offer nicer staff assistance, quality for the price .
 The staff seemed very helpful and friendly .
 The hotel staff was not helpful at all .
 stayed at swissotel for 5 nights ,  just myself and two children   all the staff could not have been more welcoming, the room service was prompt and efficient and not overly expensive .
 All the staff we encountered, from doorman to desk lady who checked us in, to check out, was professional and courteous .
 The bartender and staff were the only bright spots in the lackluster weekend .
 The check in was easy and the staff at the desk was courteous .
Very Nice Hotel Very Bad Staff .
 The staff really need to take a class in interpersonal communication .
 First of all the staff was very gracious and it is in a great location .

 The waite staff was annoying :

 The staff is very pleasant and are truly an international group .
 The staff have impeccable manners !
 But the staff treat you like royalty .
The hotel staff was courteous and helpful .
 would be satisfactory for security, and a slight air of detachment by the staff .
 Swissotel Chicago is good hotel, very nice, very helpful and nice staff .
The staff at the hotel is efficient although they didn<U+0092>t distinguish themselves from other higher, end hotels .
 The front desk staff can be clueless about this stuff, too, just handing you attitude if you complain .
 At checkin, the staff never made eye contact and only went through the motions .
 Bell staff was attentive and available .
 From the moment we checked in, the staff was courteous and meet every need, including arranging for a crib for our daughter and making sure it was safely set up before leaving our room .
However, the staff was very friendly and helpful .
 The young lady that checked us in was very pleasant and I was very appreciative of the articulate directions given to us by one of the staff members .
 Check, in and check, out were a breeze  , and the staff was just fine .
 My biggest complaint is I got used to the Fairmont's treatment, the staff is very well trained to meet your every need and are over accomodating .
 I guess the thing that bothers me most is that from the lobby decor and staff attitudes, this hotel is trying to be very snooty but then you go to your room and it is a piece of junk !
 We found the staff to be helpful and friendly .
 The hotel is in a great location, the staff is friendly and very service, oriented .
 Got Swissotel for a very good price, but was a little anxious since some of the reviews on this site complained of slow elevator service, unhelpful staff, etc .
The clientele seemed upscale, the staff was friendly and I slept so soundly every night ,  I have absolutely nothing to complain about .

 Previous reviewers complained of poor attitudes from the staff, But we found this to be very much the opposite .
 the hotel staff was excellent, polite, courteous, and Helpful in every way .
 we had such a memorable time in Chicago, and i would like to thank the staff of the Swissotel for making it such .
the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !
 All the staff at the hotel were the epitomy of politeness and professionalism .
 The staff was absolutely excellent = full service, from front desk, to health club attendants, to business center personnel .
Staff are welcoming, room was spacious, spotless, and quality .
 And the front desk staff dealt with folks with a general disdain   .
 The other big gripe was with the reception staff, who were rude .
 The hotel staff was very courteous and helpful, switching our room to one with 2 double beds from a king, even suggesting local restaurants to eat at just a short walk away .
 The bell staff was happy to hold my bags till I returned .
 Front desk staff was not pleasant at all and did not bother to satisfy our room preferences .
 Very classy entrance, nice staff .
 From checking to checking out, I loved the room and the staff .
 Everything was wonderful, including the staff and service .
 Now on the side of the service andstaff, there is a real &quot snobbish&quot  attitude that isprobably related to the fact that the Swedish, Germanprogeny of Europe work at the hotel, except as luggagehandlers, toilet cleaners and car parkers .
 The front desk staff was friendly as well .
 The location of the hotel is also good and the staff seemed friendly .
The hotel seemed understaffed at the front desk as there was only one agent when I checked in .
 I thought that the concierge staff was OK, certainly not too pleasant, but adequate .
 Of course I called downstairs and was put on endless hold due to them not being staffed sufficiently .
 It's a block away from the Hyatt which I have also stayed at and isn't as nice as the Swissotel but at least its better staffed .
 I agree with other reviewers who found the staff to be efficient, but not terribly personable .
Hotel is staff is courteous on the most part .
 The front desk staff was professional and very helpful .
 Swissotel has a famous restaurant inside it and the staff in there are charming and attentive .
 Service was great as I was greeted immediately by bellstaff from my taxi and the desk person greeted me with a great smile .
 Staff seemed efficient though not overly friendly, no good morning, etc .
 The worst were the clorox, like smell on that floor and the level of service provided by the staff .
 The staff is not helpful and sometimes hardly able to understand even a simple English sentence .
Back in the room, the cleaning staff never made it there before 4pm in the afternoon, not very exciting when you have to spend a rainy weekend in the windy city !
 And due to the lack of a sign, you cannot indicate to the cleaning staff early in the day that the room is ready .
 Extremely helpful staff, a very quiet, clean and safe property .
 FIrst at check in the desk staff individuals were a bit rude and almost seemed to be looking down at people who are not business travelers .
 I did not find the service staff to be above average in any way, with the exception of the lovely concierge .
 Front desk staff were not super easy to work with but it wasn't too bad .

 We were a little nervous after reading some of the reviews regarding the attitude of the staff, especially since we booked the room through a discount site .
 I was concerned that the hotel staff would not be KID friendly, but they were all great !
 They brought up an extra robe for our child upon request and when the ice machine was broke on the surrounding floors around us, the hotel staff went and got our ice for us !
 The staff who answered the phone was happy to hang around so that he could complete his business .
 The staff is quite unfriendly and unaccomodating .
 The staff at the front desk were very helpful and friendly and couldn't have done more for us .

Staff was courteous without being &quot over the top&quot  and was responsive to all requests .
 The staff here was incredible .
The staff was very friendly and helpful .

the staff is very professional and friendly and they go out of their way to make your stay comfortable .

 Very nice hotel with well trained staff .

" After slowing down, transmission has to be  kicked  to speed up .
 I wonder if the people who have problems with rattles and transmission were built in the US .
 The transmission, I don't know what to tell you, but good luck if you don't learn from my mistake .
I did not notice any hesitation with the transmission until after I read about it last summer, and now I sense a slight bit occasionally .
 I've had the same transmission problems hesitation issues as everyone else .
 I immediately starting noticing transmission surge during 2nd and 3rd gear during first few minutes of driving .
 The transmission is horrible, it shifts revs horribly at the wrong times, it putters when it hits 1 1 2 rpms while coasting unless you rev it or hit the breaks, if you try to start the car in really cold weather it makes a horrible grinding noise, the dash rattles ALL the time, when I try to accelerate getting on the freeway it doesnt move & scares me and when it does move it revs even after take your foot from the gas .
 The transmission doesn't shift correctly, and it has almost caused me to get into an accident twice .
 I'm pretty content with pretty much everything the car offers except the common issue of the transmission that doesn't want to seem to work when you need it .
 Unlike the common concerns with the transmission, all of my concerns problems are with everything other than the drivetrain .
 decent power for a 4 cylinder, but a dangerous hesitating transmission that toyota does not seem to want acknowledge or fix .
 My Camry has been in the shop four times for the transmission problem and still has not been fixed .
 First thing that come to me off the top of my head is the transmission .
 The transmission is the worst ever for camry .
 However, there are too many problems with the transmission .
 I have the 4 cylinder with manual transmission .
I've had no significant transmission problems .
Transmission is terrible , ,  acceleration lag is a safety issue .
 Transmission also can't decide what gear it wants to be in .
 Transmission was replaced by Toyota in the first year .
 The transmission feels terrible when it shifts .
 The transmission is crap, and erratically shifts despite modest acceleration and conservative driving habits .
 The transmission shifts smooth at all speeds .
 No sign of the transmission problem people have complained about, but I'm not expecting a Porsche .
 No rattles or transmission problems .
After driving my car almost 20,000 miles I have grown disappointed with the transmission hesitation problem as it did not show during the test drive .
 Had 2 TSBs done to recalibrate engine, transmission .
 The engine and transmission works flawlessly when a particular brand   of fuel is used and I am absolutely sure I am correct .
I have the transmission problem .
 No transmission problems as reported by so many others .
 The engine transmission was a Jekyll Hyde affair .
 Here are the transmission problems I've experienced :
 Transmission is  confused  and CONTINUALLY shifts at speeds of 28 to 35, 38 to 42, and 45 to 51 MPH .
 At this rate, the Transmission will go out @ 37,000 miles right after my Warranty expires !
 Obviously they moved the costs around to provide for the new higher power V6 and the 6 speed transmission, which are so far the car's only redeeming features !
Toyota now has a fix for the accelerator hesitation and transmission problem !
 EG7031 recalibrate ECM   engine and transmission 9159 Bulletin #EG036, 07  .
I'm not sure what everyone talks about with hesitation transmission not enough power ?
The transmission cant make up its mind it hesitates to shift .
 Transmission sticks in fourth gear and rpm surge while using the cruise control .
I am not having all the other issues everyone else is, not sure if its because mine is a manual transmission but I can't say how much I love it .
Toyota may have computerized the engine and transmission to get better gas mileage but the very best I can get is 25 mpg on the highway .
 While in cruise control and going up a slight incline the transmission is constantly shifting and the rpm goes up and down by as much as 1500 rpm .
 While driving on a straight and level road at about 40 mph the transmission is changing gears .
Loved the car but two transmissions failed within 19000 miles before I got rid of the car .
 The transmission design has major problems and so did the replacement .
 My dealer told me the new transmissions were on back order and couldn't even give me an ETA .
The side front windows limit visibility, the transmission hesitates when shifting, the back seat passenger room is spacious, the stereo system has a great bass and the versatility of CD changer, satellite, iPod, etc .
 My transmission works perfectly fine, is fun to shift but does better on its own .
 below the advertised numbers, and a jerky, balky, surging transmission that is difficult to use .
 Terrible transmission that doesn't shift right .
 the significant transmission hesitations are unacceptable and possibly unsafe, and the 4 cyl engine provides inadequate power when challenged .
 I feel the plusses outweigh the negatives, but any prospective buyer should take a serious test drive under varying conditions and actually experience transmission hesitations and the mediocre acceleration performance .
 After one week, I found a rusted conjunction block, which mounts the transmission .
 BTW, this is an auto transmission .
 I hate the transmission as it always hesitates to downshift when the power and speed is needed .
 No problems with the transmission at all .
 I have had no transmission issues or rattling, the comfort and ride of this vehicle felt to me much more high end then what I had paid .
 There have also been a few isolated incidences where I have noticed a delayed surge in the transmission, which once put me in a potentially dangerous situation .
 No transmission flares, hesitations, rattles or any other problems .
I had one for a year, Toyota was good to replace the two transmissions that failed, I was on my 3rd tranny, when my engine light came on due to a sensor in the tranny .
 The gas pedal & transmission are out of sync .
 At lower speeds when you try to give it gas an intermittent delay occurs between the gas pedal & transmission .
 Acceleration or transmission shifting :
 Quiet and refined ride, 4 cyl has sufficient power for everyday driving, and a smooth transmission that shifts well .
 Transmission not nearly as smooth as previous 4 speed .
 The transmission does occasionally get  confused  and takes a while to select the right ratio, but this does not occur frequently .
 The transmission is weak, you need to think twice before jumping into traffic .
 Obviously since I got the manual transmission I haven't had any problems with acceleration or anything like that .
 Transmission has a very strange hesitation when shifting .
Performance stinks due to transmission, always looking for another gear, constantly jerking, dash lights always dimming, lower grill always slipping out .
 When we returned home, I took the car to a transmission specialist and found out that the transmission is slipping .
 Rattles, squeaking, and transmission troubles started shortly after .
 It's VERY bothersome when the transmission down shifts the second one brakes when going down a mountain .
 The speed control as well is balky in that the slightest uphill grade causes the transmission to down shift .
 The accelerating is great, the transmission is smooth, it handles well and breaking is excellent .
I loved my '05 Camry 4 cyl automatic transmission LE, but I hate my '07 Camry 4 cyl automatic transmission LE .
 Many people have mentioned a hesitation in the transmission  I haven't seen it .
 No transmission problems, reacts instantaneously .
 However, the transmission is a little confused at times during downshifting .
 I have had issues with the new 6 speed transmission, there is a  shift flare  between 3rd and 4th gear with my car .
 Toyota is aware of the problem   and they are actually replacing my transmission since they cannot figure out what the cause is .
 Hopefully once I get a new transmission, it will be OK .
 The combination of the weak engine   at low engine speeds and the transmission hesitation is so bad that the car is, in my opinion, a safety hazard .
 Dealer recalibrated ECU, engine and transmission .
 Test drove identical camry at a different dealer  transmission reacts same way .
 Transmission slips, especially when the car is cold .
 Transmission replacement did not resolve the problem .
 Transmission is exceptionally smooth other than the first few shifts on a cold winter morning .
 Cruise control gains, RPMs accelerate up hill causing engine to make loud noise while using cruise control, higher in back making it harder to judge while backing up and transmission not completely smooth in take offs .
 The six speed auto transmission is very smooth .
After driving this car for a month it is very obvious to me that there is a design flaw in the transmission .
 The transmission constantly shifts back and forth between gears .
 The transmission is just terrible .
 Transmission is a little different than previous Camrys   but MPG and better accel .
 It has plenty of power for my needs and I have noticed no transmission problems at all .
Like everyone else, I have the problem with the transmission .
 I have had non, stop transmission problems, terrible sunroof noises, very uncharacteristic squeaks and rattles from everywhere in the dash, and unacceptable paint issues .
 It has been in for a rattling sunroof pan within 1 month of purchase  3 trips for a transmission issue  the radio quit working this summer and needed replaced and now the oil line for the VVTi has ruptured .
 The transmission leaves a lot to be desired .
 Some have found the transmission shifts too much, but it's only trying to keep the engine in the 2000, 2500 rpm range around town where there's some torque available .
 Toyota made a real goof on the engine and transmission !
 Transmission shifts up and down at highway speeds, which is annoying .
 However, the transmission is sloppy .
 It's automatic transmission is jerky and sometimes hesitant about changing gears .
 MPG is not better than 24mpg w the 4CYL, the transmission slips, the throttle by wire has been non,  responsive on several occasions, the ergonomics are  off , and the dealership is very proud of their product, too proud .
 Also, the shifting in the transmission is herky jerky .
 the auto transmission is very poorly designed and Toyota hasn't decided what to do .
 When approaching a stop with little or no gas pedal pressure, the transmission downshifts normally until the car shifts gears and suddenly lurches ahead at a higher speed .
After purchasing my 2007 Camry, which was a hassle because the salesman was pushy, I started having trouble with the transmission slipping !
 The transmission hesitates, also downshifts, hunting between gears, then lurches   .
 The engine has a horribly long hesitation when trying to accelerate and the transmission downshifts with the slightest throttle pressure and on the most minor upgrades .
 The only negative is the shifting of the transmission from 40
 The transmission is the nightmare many have already talked about .
 Perhaps the most annoying thing to me, the transmission kicks up and down on shallow declines ,  never had this in any automatic before .
 If you care about a smooth transmission run don't walk away from the 4cyl automatic 2007 camry .
LE 2007, 4cy, minor transmission hesitations as I see many other are experencing .
 Transmission does not know sometimes what it is doing when it ?
Surprisingly agile for a 4 cyl, auto transmission requires manual downshift for quick instant power .
 The transmission is flawed, it takes a few seconds for it to speed up, but once it goes it goes fast, I love the shift gate, great for easy passing !
 Due to lack, of, power or transmission problem, car down, shifts revs to 3000
 Transmission is smooth and the 2 .
 I did have a problem with the transmission but took it in and they reprogrammed the 2 computer chips in there and WOW what a difference that made .
 Power is great, transmission shifts are smooth and accurate .
 Instead of giving me a new car they finally admitted the problems with transmission and replaced it with a new one, free of cost to me   cost to them .
The transmission and cruise control is a joke .
 The transmission hesitates and stumbles .
After about 3000 miles on my 2007 Camry XLE V6 6sp Auto, it's been in the shop 4 times already and the last call from the dealer was to replace the transmission .
 transmission hunts for gears, ride quality much worse than even a mediocre car, Auto sound level doesn't work, accessory outlets do not work unless car is running or acc is on  , radio shuts off when engine is shut off .
 The transmission is not the smoothest .
 268 HP V6 with 6 speed auto transmission is very responsive and smooth .
 The transmission is seamless and, with six forward gears, the engine is virtually never strained in ordinary driving .
 8 Transmission hunts for gears 9Driver side head liner molding buzzes .
 11Transmission unexpectly deaccelates during a slow down   .
 However I have noticed, like others, that the new transmission is not that smooth, especially when accelerating from a stop .
 It can occasionally accelerate quickly and jerk you ahead, or hesitate, and sometimes I've noticed the car slow down unnaturally via the transmission .
 The 5 speed transmission shifts like one would with a manual .
 The transmission, or more specifically, the power transfer is scary .
 The reprogramming of the transmission shifting seemed to help for awhile, but it's reverted back .
 I'll probably sell it to avoid an expensive transmission repair after the extended warranty expires .
 The transmission computer is a major issue .
 Dealers do not handle the transmission matters well as I've had no luck in clearing up the inadequacies .
 After researching on the internet I found that the computer for the transmission needed reprogrammed   .
 The transmission is jerky and the gas mileage is terrible .
 It has major transmission issues, which I have had fixed twice .
 My transmission works seamlessly and there are no quality issues whatsoever .
 The transmission is  driving  me crazy .
 While the transmission is downshifting you can feel it thumping through the gears and an audible banging sound can be heard coming from the trans .
 Transmission was very rough, dealership re, programmed, it's ok now .
 The new transmission shifts too frequently to truly optimize gas consumption .
 The transmission is the absolute WORST, it is very dangerous and can cause an accident .
 They have finally fixed my transmission .
 Only problem has been the proprietary transmission glitch everyone talks about .
 I have 4 cyl with manual transmission ,  lack of power but great fuel economy .
 Transmission big issue and also rattles more than the 2001 Avalon that had 175K miles

The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .
,  Speed of map updates is awesome .
 I first bought it from another site that was cheaper by $25 and they told me that I needed to buy a memory card to download map updates .
 Another big name site did the same thing and told me that I would have to pay Garmin to update to the latest maps .
 The navigation display shows more information, such as next turn street and speed limit, and the picture update is smooth instead of jerky as I have seen in other models .
Finally, be carefull around Washington DC, because this unit has not updated the actual and latest detours arownd monuments and buildings, therefore taking you to dead ends .
 This clearly shows how often the map updates even when sitting still .

 I have Comcast cable Internet and a quad, core PC with 4gb of ram and the map update took a little over an hour to download and install .
 If you don't have a fast Internet connection the update will take some time .
I have held off from getting any GPS unit for a long time because I have a book of maps for the United States and I have always been able to update the travel  atlas  and supplement that with free maps from the internet via Google, Yahoo, etc .
_________________________ UPDATE__________________________
 With the TomTom, if you update to the newest map firmware you get everything the Garmin 765 has minus the traffic .
 And it is $79 a year to update the maps .
 However, the points of interests are substandard, it would not pick up restuarants that we know have been there >3 yrs, and that was after we updated the maps, which was a 3 hr download .
> With your savings, you can buy Lifetime map updates from the Garmin web site for $119 !
> Links up flawlessly to my Mac using Garmin RoadTrip, WebUpdates, etc .
 I ran the updater and there was an upgrade for the software and text for Jack TTS and Samantha TTS .
 Today, I checked the Web updater again and their was a second update for Jack TTS and Samantha TTS .
 Very disappointing that the product does not come with a standard power cable or even a USB cable ,  especially considering that is what you must have to use for software updates and product registration .
 Then it said I needed to update some software I said OK .
5 It came with the latest maps  Garmin City Navigator NT North America 2009  and I didn't have to update it .
The maps seem to be fairly updated .
 I found too many users who said that the traffic update feature   is not all that dependable a feature .
I found the maps to be inaccurate at first, but after I updated them from Garmin's website everything is golden .
 Otherwise you can't update the maps !
 Also make sure you update the unit software from the Garmin website on a regular basis .
 Use the  Webupdater  so that the unit is running at its peak .
 I avoided the more complex ones as I had read that FM updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .
 It can be done by phone but if you do it that way you don't get the one free update on the maps .
I updated to the latest 2010 map soon after I received the unit, so the map is accurate to me .
 I also like the way that it connects to the internet   to update all of its maps .
 All I can really say about this, is update the Firm Ware straight out of the box, and when the GPS shows that it is acquiring signals   don't skip that .
 I also like the fact that Garmin makes the most recent map updates available   rather than leave users hanging like some other GPS manufacturers .
Once you have the unit, you'll want to update the maps .
 Once receiving the unit, you get one map update download which must be used within 60 days .
 One guy posted on the forum that he had an older device and paid to update to the 2009 map 12 hours before the 2010 map was posted .
 Directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .
 I discovered that I need it while trying to register the device and or to get updated maps at the Garmin website .
 More often than not, the estimated arrival time is updated 1, 2 minutes before the last expected arrival time .
Map update ,  when you register it on, line   you get an offer for one free map update .
 I plan to wait almost the full 60 days to get the latest update, then probably never purchase an update .
 By the time it needs a new update the unit will be obsolete .
 MapSource also makes it easy to update your unit's map annually .
 I have no need for the cell phone connection or traffic updates, just wanted a navigator to guide me from point A to point B as I get lost easily in my own town and to set up long trips .
 The only nitpick disappointment was when I downloaded the free 2010 map update it dosn't show road extensions completed a few years ago .
 Getting the prompted software update might have corrected that .
 easy to connect to garmin to download your free updated map .
,  Also very quick and I mean quick reroute when you miss a turn plus smooth update position when moving, not choppy on the screen .
,  Updating the GPS took way to long and I have DSL ,  4 hours to download a 2GB map update and 3 hours to install the program to the GPS .
 I read that some Mac user could not get it to update at all .
,  No traffic update but don't really need it
 We started with a non, touch screen which was great, then we updated to the streetpilot C330 which was a dream .
 The sound isn't that bad, Just make sure you get your free map update from the Garmin site within the 60 day time period .
 Not so ,  tried the Garmin web site for an updated map and was told by Garmin that none was available .
 Loading a map update is another experience I won't go into .
 Haven't driven with it yet since the update but it seems crisp and with more detail .
 Glad I updated the map and software .
 Since the update , Drove it locally in San Diego and it worked fabulously .
 in a  test  the day I received the unit, before map updates, I was directed to exit the freeway many miles before it made sense .

"I bought the 8, gig Ipod Nano that has the built, in video camera .
  Itunes has an on, line store, where you may purchase and download music and videos which will install onto the ipod .
I have lots of music cd's and dvd's, so currently I'm just interested in storing some of my music and videos on the ipod so I can enjoy them on my vacation, and while at work .
There's a right way and wrong way to store music and videos onto the ipod .
 Audio and video recording are a step above the competition .
 As always, the video screen is sharp and bright .
ipod nano even better with video camera !
 This time around, Apple is branching out of its iPod formula in a small, but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the Nano with its own video camera .
 Still, video fans should consider stepping up to a product with a larger screen, such as the Zune HD   or iPod Touch .
The user interface of the 5G Nano remains almost entirely unchanged with the exception of a few new menu items for the video camera, FM radio, and fitness features .
I can listen to it without headphones, i can record video .
 It looks nicer than my other one, love the video and everything else this one can do
 wish BB could engrave them too  announcer for songs is kind of annoying  Haven't yet tried the video, but very pleased with the size and quality of my music on this nano .
 Hard to delete videos from the Nano device .
 The video design allow you to take different types of vidoe like x, ray, monochrome, and twist making it enjoyable to play .
 The video quality is actually fairly good, my friend toook a video with it and she uploaded it to facebook and it came out great !
 It eve ncame out better than a video she took with an actual camera camera !
 the video quality is perfect .
Great for music, just OK for video
 Video recorder only, cannot take just photos .
 the VIDEO, VOICE and PEDOMETER recorder is one great addition to it .
 As for the video camera it's a nice addition considering it's an mp3 player first and foremost, I think people are going to go into this and think maybe I can replace my old video, NO .
 It just a solid low quality video camera some of the lighting or your fingers may get in the way of the actual recording but once you get use to it, it can become fun .
 I find it weird that it will take video but not still pics .
 It looks just like the 4th generation, except on the back, there's a camera to take video clips or whatever it is you want to .
 i hate itunes, but it seems to be a necessary evil in order to tag say a video as music and not a movie, so though i originally started with 3rd party apps for syncing i have since switched to itunes .
This time around, Apple is branching out of its iPod formula in a small, but not insignificant way by gracing the back of the Nano with its own video camera .
 The video works very well for such a small sensor and it is so easy and convenient to use .
  We have had portable video players for our children as our cars are not equipped with these devices .
 Video camera quality and sound are also surprising for such a small unit .
 Not a tremendous surprise here, as we believed the sixth, generation  true video iPod  would not be announced until later in the year or even early in 2007 .
5G lies a more mature iPod, many steps wiser and more able than its one, year, old  The iPod gains many incremental improvements, including a brighter screen and better video battery life, but probably the most appealing aspect is the tantalizing price points of $249 for the 30GB version and $349 for the huge 80GB version   .
 The 80GB is enticing for video addicts both for the capacity iTunes movies are about 1 .
 The video camera is nice, just wish it could take stills .
 The one problem with the video camera is it is not the easiest thing to use .
 I also like that videos can be watched on it as well as listening to it without the ear phones that is a really great feature .
 The only odd thing is that is has a video camera but doesn't have a single shot camera .
 Easy to use, Video Camera, Radio, Size, Sound Quality  .
 The battery doesn't last a long time especially when you're recording or watching a video but I just listen to music most of the time and it lasts me a good length of time doing that .
 The video quality is great and has different settings .
 Definitely easier to use than the IPod Touch, and the video camera feature is awesome .
 That way you will have enough storage to add music, video and pictures !
 I haven't found anything that is not so great  This is a multi use MP3 player with the ability to make videos, music and videos .
 Great new features in this iPod generation include voice recording, listening to radio, and even filming video .
 Has video camera and voice memo .
 The video looks great and it's easy to use .
 No  off  switch  Compared to Gen 4 the ability to listen without speakers and the video camera is great .
 As easy to use as any other iPod, and the video is good .
 She loves to make her own videos and play them back .
 The videos are so clear I just love it .
 However, the way it is designed, it is clumsy to hold while recording a video .
 camera does only video, not pictures  Way better than 2nd gen nano .
 Love the camera, but wish it had photo capabilities, rather than just video .
 It's got radio, video, camera, video camera, small  .
 Love the pedometer feature on the nano and the video camea  .
 The color, the video, overall the item is great  .
 The size is very nice and compact and the videos are beautiful !
 it would be nice to delete songs when they get old  the video camera is the best, i use it all the time .
 It was fine quality sounds for  roof, raising  music and also insane levels of clearity for music videos or movies on the go !
 The video camera feature is awesome enough, but all of the special effects are incredible .
 He loves shooting video and then viewing it in  cyborg  mode or in sepia tones .
Our 12 year old loves the IPod ,  especially the video camera feature .
 lots of features  I got this for my son because he wanted an MP3 player and a video camera for Christmas .
 Like the extra features ,  pedometer, video camera, radio, speakers .
haven't quite mastered the video camera yet, but I'm okay with that !
 Movies, videos, music, music, music .
 Plenty of memory to add all your favorte music and videos .
 The 16g holds a lot of music and video .
video, motion sensing, screen size and sllek look  I recently upgraded from the 2nd generation Nano and love the new features of the newest model .
 Can't believe the picture quality and ease of video use !
 It will take video, but not pictures  ?
 Secondly, the thing has the capability to record video, but won't take pictures .
 Yeah, that's typed correctly ,  video, but not pictures .
 Seems kinda silly that they would go right to video and completely neglect photography .
 My daughter loves taking video, as well as the music & pics !
 She takes videos and pics with it all the time .
 I decided to get this iPod cause of the Memory and the Video Cam in the back .
 The video camera and the graphics is so cool !
 Easy to use and cool video camera !
 Comes in different colors, make videos, and holds alot of music .
 Small, holds lots of songs, video, easy to use  .
 Can't figure out how to review the video clips I record .
  This is an easy to use item, but is slightly confusing to use when trying to review video clips .
 It takes video and has a really cool radio feature on it, according to the kids .
 easy to use, cool helpful features, video camera, voice over  .
 The video camera is great   and the different effects are fun to mess around with .
 It would be nice if the video camera zoomed in a little and if there was a regular camera as well, but those are pretty minor complaints .
  My daughter thinks that the video clarity is amazing and finds the built in speakers awesome .
 The camera and video feature are wonderful .
 Holds tons of music, video, pics .
 I wish the video camera had a pause on it, but you can't pause .
 It can hold tons of music, video, pics and watching movies on the plane is nice .
 I also wish the video camera had a pause on it, but it doesn't pause and starts with a new video everytime you stop it .
 She didn't want the touch, she wanted the nano because you can video, it has the radio that she can play back the songs and she likes the size .
 The video camera is great and the screen size is a nice size
 We haven't tried the video yet, so I can't comment on that .
 great video quality, no ear buds required internal sound system sounds great  .
 Still to new to we'll see  Great product, video feature is awesome and I love how there is now internal sound and you don't have to use ear buds with it .
 Don't really need video camera  eventhough we don't use the video that much the rest of the features are great .
 It does so many things,  Wow, nav, video, mp3, and more !
 I love how easy it is to download from ITunes and the fact I can also do video  .
 I am learning to navigate the menu better that at first and love that fact that I can take a video .
 Its easy to use and love the new video feature .
 It does have some nice features such as the video camera and the radio .
 He has been using it consistently ever since and has nothing but praise for it and it's many options  loves the video cam and the music player recorder especially
 Watching any videos drains the battery very quickly .
 Glad you listen to the radio, play games and take video  .
 none of my old Nano asseccories work with this one  Fun new Ipod, the video feature is fun but difficult to learn how to use .
 I've downloaded a lot of CDs and music from iTunes, also a few music videos,which are great fun to watch and hear .
 Great for spot video if you do not have a camera availabe on hand .
 some changes such as video camera and bigger screean, but it was just ok .
Great video camera and the funcionality is awesome
 Video camera function and the blending of songs at the end and beginning  .
 nothing  The functionality and video camera were great innovations added to the newest generation of Ipod !
 It's very easy to use and its video camera is very nice and it doesn't ghost .
 and the video quality is very good, and the sound quality is very good as well .
 Sound quality, video quality, easy to use, space, customizable  .
 The colors are awesome, the sound is great and it hold tons of songs and videos !
 It has great video quality for such a small device .
 the video recorder, sound, look  .
 has bigger screen, video camera  .
 the picture for the video is awesome its very clear and easy to see .
 features, look and feel, video  .
 Video, even in low light, is impressive .
 Even the built, in video camera is very good .
 I'm really disappointed that Apple is so proprietary that you can't use anything but iTunes to add music and videos to an iPod .
 It has a built in video camera, and it shoots in high quality, which I was surprised at .
 n you can put music videos pictures .
 The video camera is cool, but I don't know that I would use it much .
 This can record videos and it is also Very Very Light Weight !
 i couldnt think of a single thing  this ipod is reallly great you can shoot videos listen to the radio plus you have 16 gigs of memory it is aweosme i really love it because its still as small as the last one only with a bigger screen and great color
 The video and external speaker components were a surprise on the 5th Gen iPod .
 I love the video camera it has on it, the pedometor is awesome to use and best of all I can listen to music on it when I'm doing other stuff on my computer when it might be slowed down when listening to music on it .
 Awesome features fm radio, video camara, pedometer and more  .
 Nothing  What will Apple think of next for their Nano, the video camara records awesome video even in dim lighting .
 All the neat little features and surprisingly good video camera !
 I took it to class and decided to test it out and everyone was surprised by how good the video quality was .
 I'm planning on hiking half, dome next year and this is much much more lightweight than the video camera I have so it will definitely be accompanying me !
 fm radio lots of storage for music, videos and pictures alarm clock to your tunes blue color lock button so you don't accidentally turn it off on ease of use Cons :
 Hard to get videos onto computer  This was a purchase I made after I returned my Sony Walkman .
 A must, buy for everybody who loves music and video .
 video camera built in and music plays without head phones  .
 need a video program on your computer to obtain video  Great product for the price .
 I had the iPod Video but it did not work with my new Nike
 chip so I bought the newest iPod video the day it came out .
 I cannot figure out how to get the video I record off of the IPod .
 ,  I cannot figure out how to get the video I recorded on my Nano off to upload it to Facebook or You Tube .
shoes if using vid cam for long time, it kills battery  Standard Def video recording, but still sharp !
 Only things I wish they added is measuring distance [not just steps] on the pedometer, better sound on the speaker, and a  capturing still images  with the video recording feature .
 The video recording feature is the best part .
7 out of 10 have not used video yet but the pixels would be just the same .
 The product is very useful if you want to go out for a jog and listen to your music or watch some videos if you stuck on a bus or subway .
 Video camera, FM turner, Speaker, Pedometer  .
 Location of the video camera, and the gap between the click wheel and ipod  The Best Ipod ever and has the best features ever .
 Easy to use video camera, Big screen, Fun color  .
 Which I am sure all Nano's are like that  LOL The video camera is so much fun !
 new look, shape and video cam feature  .
 Smudgy finger prints  I like the Video voice over color, purple I like hearing the Ipod w out the ear plugs .
 light weight, radio, video camera  .
 I have an old 60GB ipod video that I use in my car and now I use this ipod for walking around campus and such .
 The video camera is a great feature to have, however its not that high of a quality when you transfer it onto your computer .
 Camera has great video effects   .
 The videos you record do not show up on iTunes though, you have to go to My Computer and find the ipod drive, then open the folder named DCIM, and the video files are in  .
 When you're not in a game or watching a video, if you turn it on the side, coverflow displays, however you can turn this feature off .
 I mean I do have my cell that takes pics and videos but I just love the picture video the NANO records .
 And I just foundout you don't need the head phones in the iPod to listen to your music or videos !
 Video Camera with fun special effects, FM radio  .
 the glossy fingerprint attracting finish compared to last year's beautiful matte finish  Great improvements with the video camera, really fun special effects, easy to use ,  also great FM radio with pause feature .
then it would be perfect oh and make a 32 or 64gb version so I can fit all my music and have lots of room for video ,  thanks !
 But overall I love it ,  between the radio, speaker, microphone, video camera, effects, there are enough new features to justify buying a new nano .
It's great to have a decent video camera with you at all times if you don't have an iphone .
 Had the original iTouch but I was burglarized andwas waiting for the iTouch with video but can't wait any longer .
 Video is impressive, speaker sound is good for size, easy menus, screen is big enough to watch movies .
 The videos are very crisp and clean, the video camera is nice, I was very surprised with the quality .
 Small size and Color, Gettin your Money's worth, nice screen, and video camera  .
 I do like the video camera on it .
 The mic and camera are great, speaker is great for video playback or bedtime movie watching, the screen is now even bigger and the device is the same size but Lighter than the 4th gen nano !
 The Video Recording Quality, Price, Size, Weight, Radio, Pedometer, Voice Over  .
 video camera, radio, great price for a 16 gig, not a fingerprint magnet, small .
 cant take pictures just videos, and u need the headphones given for the radio  good for just listening to music and for your car .
 Easy to set up, has a video camera and a radio built in .
 The video camera is not as good as I thought it was going to be .
 NOTHING  Ipod nano has a VIDEO CAMERA it is so cool, ROCK
 the video is very clear, the built in speaker is pretty good, the radio is very useful and overall it's just great !
 He was delighted as it had a video and camera which his original one did not have .
 It has plenty of room for her music and she loves taking pictures and making short videos with it .
 While the Nano allows for video and audio, the IPod touch has interactivity and
 While the Nano allows for video and audio, the IPod touch has interactivity and
its really good up to apples usual standard sound quality and video quality is brillant and is ideal for anyone !
The video camera feature is nice but I don't understand why they didn't allow for picture taking ?
 It's small and lightweight, it looks amazing, the video quality is way better than I ever imagined it would be, and the screen is huge .
The seller advertised it as the NEWEST model which should be able to take pictures and video .
It is of the best buys I've done, sound quality, video and radio is excellent
 Great sound quality, love the video recording too  :
 It's just a shame it only takes video and not still photos .
 It has a cool video recorder, but i could've done without it .
 The video camera works great and the battery
 If you had other ipods with the feauture of puting videos, when you synch them, they don't appear
 Video option is easy to use .
 I have the 5th gen iPod video, and this thing blows it away !
The video is surprisingly good !
 I do wish that it also took pictures as well as video though .
So, the only thing about the iPod nano that I don't like   is the placement of the video camera .
 Video quality is better than I expected .
Amazing amount of music photos videos can be stored .
 Video taking feature is interesting .
 It plays music, videos, radio, records
 The video capability is incredible, and so easy to use .
My wife and I are really pleased with our Nano Ipods that we purchased from you so easy to use and good to have a camera as well as a video John Coleman
 It's a nice little gadget, I've put some songs on it and the video camera is good
 The video camera is crystal clear and the memory space is more than ideal for all your needs .

"  The voice prompts and maps are wonderful especially when driving after dark .
I also thought the the voice prompts of the 750 where more pleasant sounding than the 255w's .
 The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .
 I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .
Some of the voices are annoying .
 My understanding is that Garmin really compressed the voice in this unit, far more than in previous units .
 I like my older unit better ,  better voice quality and it simply tells you how far to the next turn and what direction to turn .
 The quality of the voice   leaves a bit to be desired .
The text to speech is great for not having to look down at the screen endangering yourself and others on the road and after the voice updates the Garmin put out for the 255W the scratchiness and robotic sounding voice became crisp and very audible .
 I note that a competitor is coming out with a Homer Simpson version of the GPS voices .
I wish that the GPS had a remote control that allowed you to change screens without having to lean forward while driving, or better yet, responded to voice commands .
First I want to address the  potential problem  on 255w which is the robotic sound, I personally think it is absolutely understandable, the female sound is a little vauge at some point, however the man's   voice is very clear to me, so this is not a problem for me .
Some of the negatives that were mentioned that I did not find to be true were that you can't understand the voice   The possible list could go on and on but I think you get the idea .
 The voice is somewhat robotic and some street names are mispronounced, but it's all understandable, I read comments in some reviews that the voice is not loud enough, but I have no problem   .
 The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .
 You have your choice of several languages and voices .
 Also, for no extra charge, you are able to download several voices and vehicles from the Garmin site .
 For instance, you can change the voice of the GPS .
The voice descriptions of the routes are clear and easily understood, even for me with a hearing loss .
 At volumes of 60% or above, there is so much distortion that the voices sound like they are coming from a blown speaker .
 It seems to be caused by Garmin decreasing the file sizes and quality of the voice files .
 On previous models like the 350 and 360 the voice files were 100
 Its almost impossible to understand the voice as its metallic tinny .
 Many a times, this is a distraction as you will be wondering what the voice command said .
 Other than the Magellan's screen being an inch smaller ,  but really noticeable ,  the Magellan did not have text to voice, and often would take a much longer route even though we told it to take freeways .
The most noticeable thing is that the screen is much easier to read, and that the text to voice is extremely valuable and much better than a beep just as you need to turn .
 And the voice and streets match perfectly .
 the female voice   is much clearer than Jack, the male American English .
 I couldn't understand the Australian or English voices, but Samantha is clear as a bell and can even be heard over the radio .
 The screen is easy to see, the voice tells you where you are and it's very accurate .
 When the voices are turned up loud enough for my satisfaction, the speakers sound like they are overpowered, making a distorted noise during the loudest parts of the system's voices .
 It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .
 The voices seem too robotic .
 However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .
 Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .
 So I called Garmin and ask if any fix was comming out to fix the voice .
 I bought the 255W and the voice was tinny and soft .
 Voice commands were mechanical but clear .
 I had no problem with the clarity of the voice system .
 A clear voice tells me when the turns are coming up, as well as the names of the roads .
 the unit takes you on weird routes and people don't like the TTS voice .
 The user remarks on voice on saying the street name was important to me and easy use of device so too was important .
The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .
The default voice is extremely clear and easy to understand, so I never even tried any of the alternative voices .
I like being able to select different voices, however when I am using Daniel with the English accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .
The voice instructions given are clear, but as few people mentioned in their reviews, you need to get familiar with the pronunciation .
Not only the voice gives turn, by, turn instructions, the map on the screen also has a thick purple line indicating the route ahead .
 This is a big help as I was essentially following that thick purple line while listening to the voice instructions to make sure I was make correct turns when in Buffalo .
 Often when I'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .
 I have no problems reading it in bright sunlight, but with the voice to text, the screen is almost unnecessary .
 I had read about concerns the voice prompts were not loud enough .
 I also love the small things, such as being able to download new voices, and vehicles, I plan on getting all the vehicles has on their site, because there is one for every season, for every mood, every time of year .
 The screen is crystal clear and the voice in it is nice and loud .
 There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .
I agree that the sound isn't great for the TTS voice but it's definitely audible and I like it over all .
 The non TTS voice is more pleasant .
 The only complaint that I have if you even want to call it that is that the text, to, speech voices sound pretty robotic .
 You can also change the voice you hear and your vehicle type .
 The Voice Prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the GPS, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the GPS with a touch of the screen .
The unit worked well and I had no issue with the voice as I had my window up all the time and did not have the radio on .
 I switched over to the male voice which I happen to like better .
The screen is clear and the instructions are good though again if you have a lot of exits or turns all in the same spot you have to be careful to just listen to the voice and watch the road or you can miss the turn .
Under the Services link on the Garmin site look for the Goodies section and The Garmin Garage link for extra car images and sometimes voices too .
 The only complaint I have is that the voice is a little bit tinny especially if the volume is turned up .
 The voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .
 The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .
 The voice it has is clear and readable even for my 79 year old ears .
The voice is clear and easy to understand .
 Since my near vision isn't very good I like the combination of the voice prompts and the big white arrow indicating an approaching turn, especially at night .
0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !
I rated this item with 4 stars because it does not have Jill's voice and there's no way to put it in .
 All the english voices you have suck big time, you will not like not even one and the new Samantha voice really sucks big time .
 What they did was, they made new voice files a lot smaller that on the previous models and all the new voices sound like crap and there's no way to copy the voices from other devices like you use to with the previous models .
 If you input an address on where you want to go, it tells you how to get there in very clear graphics and also with a computer voice that is not obnoxious to listen to .
I'm really glad I bought it though, and like the easy to read graphics, the voice used to tell you the name of the street you are to turn on, the uncannily accurate estimates of mileage and time of arrival at your destination .
 Map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .
The voice prompts  are mostly clear, sometimes quirky and the volume levels adequate .
 The voice system gave ample time to make turns and lane changes .
 Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .
 From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .
 The pre, installed english voice is a little robotic but if you switch to the british american it is perfect .
 After ample research   I selected the Nuvi 255W for it's abundant features, wider screen and voice communication .
VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .
 Love that you can change the voice person talking on this one, my last one didn't do that .
Others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .
 I must say, though, that I believed it would have a certain cachet to use the British English female voice that is a standard feature but found that she could not properly pronounce some of the street names in my area .
The voice commands are excellent and timely .
 The model 255W that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .
 The voice is very clear and gives plenty of warning when we need to make a turn ahead .
